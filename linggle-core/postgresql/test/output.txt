Introduction: The Great Depression [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  For the purpose of this week, we’ll essentially be resting in the 1930s, essentially. It’s a week’s worth of lecture dealing with the Great Depression. In October of 1929, the stock market crashes, and in a quick cascade of events, Herbert Hoover, then the President, finds himself out of office and Franklin Roosevelt is elected promising a New Deal, a New Deal for America. This week’s lectures are about the Great Depression, Roosevelt’s New Deal, and several critical moments and developments related to the African American experience. And I want you to–We should all start with a basic understanding of my approach to the nineteen–to the 1930s. If the twenties can be understood as the decade of the New Negro, a new sort of social and cultural and political world view, the 1930s needs to be understood as a decade of retrenchment and political advancement. We’ve seen this before, going into the late nineteenth century and into the turn of the twentieth century. And we’re just seeing a–a new cycle of people gathering themselves up and articulating new visions and new agendas, or new, new methods to pursue on these agendas for the future.\nAs far as retrenchment, after so many cultural celebrations and giddiness of the jazz age, as, you know, the soldiers that have returned, the economic downturn made a different–not new really, but a different set of priorities come to the surface. The economy’s in tatters and African Americans are the hardest hit. And as far as political advancement is concerned, along with the retrenchment comes a range of political responses to these setbacks that demonstrate an independence of spirit among African Americans as far as political possibilities. Now this retrenchment and political advancement, I don’t want to make too much of a big deal. One can identify these themes in any particular decade or moment in time of course. But there is–there’s something very special I think about the 1930s as far as these aspects are concerned.\nThe 1930s forms the backdrop for the modern civil rights movement, that movement that is popularly thought of as occurring from Brown v. Board’s decision in 1954 up until King’s assassination. As you’ll come to understand very quickly, that notion, boundedness of the civil rights movement, is really sort of discarded by historians at this point. And many historians are talking about a long civil rights movement, a movement that predates the Supreme Court decision and goes back a decade or more. I’ll talk more about this in a–in a week or so, this phenomenon of the long civil rights movement. But regardless of where one decides to sort of start the civil rights movement, you need to understand the thirties is clearly the seedbed, the moment where a whole new range of political strategies are going to be articulated, and these grow out of this moment of retrenchment, trying to gathers–gather oneself together in light of economic despair.\nChapter 2. The New Deal [00:03:30]\nNow I want to cover the story of the 1930s. I mean for any era, there’s too many different stories one could tell, but I want to explore the themes of retrenchment and political advancement in the 1930s via a number of stories. And this covers this lecture and Wednesday’s lecture. I’ll be talking about the Black Cabinet, the Scottsboro boys, the New Negro Alliance, the National Negro Congress, Marian Anderson and the March on Washington movement. This is a series of different–different kinds of events that really marked, marked us right through the 1930s with the March on Washington movement taking shape in 1941. Throughout this whole era, or this era–the umbrella covering this era, is the New Deal, and that’s what I want to start off with very quickly, so we have just a–sort of a shared understanding of what the New Deal is doing and why it’s important.\nSo the stock market crashes in October Twenty-Nine. The country’s economically destabilized, millions are thrown out of work. Black and white unemployment skyrocketed, but blacks are particularly hard hit. Job shortages and old fashioned racism combine in such a way that a familiar–familiar rallying cry would be hear–heard at job lines and such when a black person showed up. And I’m quoting, “No jobs for niggers until every white man has a job.”  A time of economic stress, good old fashioned racism makes itself known loud and clear. Even in such major cities like Atlanta, some sixty-five percent of, of employable blacks needed public assistance. This is economic devastation. Hoover believed in volunteerism and thought the economy would turn itself around without government intervention. But by the time he realized the scope of the problem, he found himself losing the presidential election. FDR’s elected, promises a New Deal.\nNow the New Deal’s a massive federal experiment in big government. It was an alphabet soup, as, as historians refer to it, an alphabet soup of agencies, each representing different forms of federal intervention. And I’m putting a–sev–a whole bunch of them, not all of them, up on the board here, and I’m going to very quickly go through them to help you understand the scope of the change. You have the FSA, or the Farm Security Administration, and the Agricultural Adjustment–Adjustment Administration, two that are organizations that are very important to African Americans, aside from being important to all Americans, because African Americans are still predominantly–although it’s shifting–still predominantly an agricultural population. They had the National Recovery Act, the NRA–that and I’ll get into a little more about the NRA, it’s very important, in a few minutes–that among other things establishes the minimum wage, or establishes minimum wages is the better way to put it. And there’s a very curious relationship with African American–African Americans and the jobs that they hold.\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority and the Rural–Rural Electric–Electrification Administration, these are up here really to point out what kind of radical change the New Deal is really all about. This is an era when they’re actually bringing electricity for the first time to large parts of the country through, through the TVA and hydroelectricity and rural electrification. It’s a radical reordering of how the country’s going to work. National Youth Administration, NYA, which as we’ll see, I’ll talk briefly about it later on, is one of these many administrations that has a Negro division, and the Negro division becomes important. I mean I’ll, I’ll–You can bookmark it for the moment. Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC, literally putting mostly men to work by digging ditches, planting trees, giving them some sort of job to do so they can get some wage from the federal government, so they can feed themselves. Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the PWA turns into the WPA, doing work on public projects. Social Security is established, the Securities and Exchange Commission is established, the FDIC, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. All of these are brand new during this era.\nSo what we consider the essential work of the federal government is, in our contemporary moment is essentially created during the New Deal. All is a radical attempt to end the Great Depression. And we have been wrestling, we, political leaders, activists, have been wrestling with the legacy of the New Deal ever since. Now the point of listing all of these agencies up here is not just that many of these had a direct effect on African American employment and, as you’ll see, political possibility, but it also will bring into–I’m sort of for–projecting here a bit–it will underscore changes–how can I…not changes–articulations, new articulations of changes in terms of the limits of the federal government. We’ll see during our lecture of the civil rights movement, there’s a core issue and that’s the fed–limits of federal government versus states’ government. With the explosion in the size of the federal government, you can see this problem looming ever larger on the horizon.\nNow very basic questions, was the New Deal successful?  It’s all an experiment. And economically, the answer is mixed. Yes, there is no doubt, it saved millions from starvation, I mean, literally saving folks from starving to death. But the economy doesn’t actually turn around until the U.S. begins arming Europe as it heads toward Second World War. When the U.S. becomes a military factory and then itself becomes involved in the Second World War, that’s when the economy turns–absolutely booms and it turns around at that point. So economically it saves people from starving but it doesn’t turn the economy around. Politically, it’s much more complicated. From an institutional standpoint, there’s no doubt that the New Deal’s significant. Whether it’s successful I guess might be an interesting word to wrest with here because, as I said before, it makes the modern American political state. It does it in the space of just a few years.\nNow from the standpoint of the African American experience, was the New Deal successful in terms of politics here?  There’s a real mixed record. On the ground, too many federal programs were left to local administrators to run. So you have–and this is where something like the Farm Security Administration, Agricultural Administration–Adjustment Administration, are really important. Federal policy is saying you’re not going to discriminate. Everybody’s going to get a sh–a cut of this New Deal. But the bailouts are handed out at the local level, at the local Farm Bureau, let’s say, and localized racial practices simply just don’t disappear. So you have growing out of the New Deal, or during the New Deal, American farms being saved, but the farms that are being saved overwhelmingly are those that are white-owned and not black-owned. So when you think of the New Deal from the standpoint of did it benefit African Americans, you can look at federal–at, at the sort of national policy and see something, non-discrimination pacts, but local level’s where it really matters, you see a very different story there.\nNow just as some of these–many of these New Deal programs were doing something important by being non-discriminatory in their language, and then therefore at the local level being more complicated, they weren’t all perfect at the federal level of articulation. And this is where the NRA, the National Recovery Administration, really needs to be understood. As I said before, the NRA designed a set of minimum wages, basically wage standards, across the country. So, for instance, if you are rolling steel, you’re going to get paid a certain minimum wage. If you are–boy, of the billion and a half jobs, I can’t think of anything right now. If you’re–[laughs] God, pick a job–you are doing some other mechanized thing, how’s that for a complete bailout?  You’re going to get paid a certain set wage. Now the reason I was flailing here, because there are certain areas the NRA doesn’t address the minimum wage, and I kept wanting to say those things; That’s why I was fumbling. It does not establish minimum wages for people in agricultural sector. It does not set minimum wages for people doing domestic work. Guess what African Americans are mostly employed in: agricultural work and domestic work.\nNow there are all kinds of reasons that people who conceived the NRA had for not putting floors at, at certain wages for certain industries, agriculture and domestic work in this case. They weren’t explicitly about, “Oh, let’s stick it to these people.”  But the fact was, the effect was, they were sticking it to these people, to farmers in general and to people doing domestic work. The NRA then becomes a symbol for how little the New Deal was doing for black America. Long term effects, there’s no doubt, very important, and we’ll see that in the next couple of weeks, from the concept of what the federal government is. From an institutional standpoint, there’s no doubt, it’s important, it’s critical, it’s saving lives. When it comes to black life on the ground, a mixed bag. When it comes to NRA, which had really more power than any other of these administrations to change the quality of black life, to sort of bolster it up, no dice. So African Americans start calling the National Recovery Administration, the letters NRA, referred to as Negro Rights Abused, Negro Rights Assassinated, Negro Removal Act, Negroes Ruined Again.\nChapter 3. The Black Cabinet [00:14:38]\nNow we’re talking bread and butter issues here. But politics of course exist at the symbolic level, and when it comes to African Americans, there is no doubt that symbolically, the New Deal was an overwhelming success. The political symbolism of the New Deal for blacks came mostly through the establishment of a group called the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, the Black Cabinet. They’re the same thing. The Black Cabinet was an unofficial–it’s important to understand that part–an unofficial collection of race advisors, and that was their title, who stood in various places in Roosevelt’s administration. This was the first broad-based group of federally appointed bureaucrats and administrators who were African American, at the federal government–in the federal government’s history. Prior to this moment, you might have Frederick Douglass appointed to federal position, Booker T. Washington being consulted by the President about certain kinds of ideas and policies. But in the New Deal, you’re actually getting a, a cadre of African Americans with federal appointments, working within the administration on a full-time basis.\nThe members of the Black Cabinet were all highly-educated and all male, with the lone exception of Mary McLeod Bethune, who was the one, well, one female. Seems my, there we go. Mary McLeod Bethune. And the spelling is correct and the pronunciation’s correct, it’s “McCloud.”  Mary McLeod Bethune, the sole female in the Black Cabinet, who also happened to be regarded as the cabinet’s leader. Now the Cabinet, the Black Cabinet, leaves no discernible policy record or legacy. Their job, the job, the things they did were mainly accomplished behind the scenes. And, in fact, I, I know this, this–I planned to write my dissertation on the Black Cabinet, only to discover, once I got here, there was no record. So, new dissertation topic.\nTheir job was mainly conducted behind the scenes, so you’d have a Secretary of the Interior, or a Secretary of Agriculture, wanting to, you know, find out what’s going on with black America. They have a race advisor, and they would assign him–overwhelmingly him, of course, except for Mary McLeod Bethune–the task of finding out, or being the, the touchstone to, to understand what’s happening in black America. And there might be an issue bubbling up, say in the National Parks or some other place, that the race advisor might know about, and would put sort of a bug in his boss’s ear, and it might gently change administration policy, or maybe even law that way. But we don’t actually know the literal changes they made. But we do know that they were very important symbolically. And the most important person symbolically in this regard is Mary McLeod Bethune.\nBethune, who’s the head of the Negro Youth Division of the National Youth Administration, an educator, lifelong educator, and then, most importantly, a close friend of the first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. Bethune is seen, seen to be the voice of black America in so many ways, in this, in this, in the, the Black Cabinet, that is, because she had access. And there was–it was op–it was not a secret. It was well known that if you wanted to talk to Franklin Roosevelt and you’re African American, you had to go through Eleanor Roosevelt, and if you wanted to talk to Eleanor Roosevelt, you had to go through Mary McLeod Bethune to get access. So the Black Cabinet needs to be understood as the first political insiders in black America, and I’m talking high politics here. This is an era where the Black Cabinet officers would be trotted out. Pictures of them, or sometimes themselves literally, trotted out, sent on sort of as part of a delegation to a particular area of town, the country, representing the federal government to a black enclave. And they were seen as embodying the fact that Roosevelt cared. Whether you’re talking Mary McLeod Bethune or somebody else, Roosevelt cared because he had people appointed to express or deal with, address their concerns. This is how they’re symbolically so important, and it’s also important to know that over the course of the 1930s, during FDR’s presidency, through the interventions of the New Deal, sometimes literally, most often symbolically, African Americans turn from a Republican voting population to a Democrat–Democratic voting population. A complete shift by the time you get to the late 1930s. The Black Cabinet’s important in that process. \nChapter 4. The Scottsboro Boys [00:20:25]\nNow just as you’re seeing the establishment of the first sort of professional administrators, bureaucrats, African American, in the federal government, certainly at high level, there is–this is also an era of incredible political setback and disappointment. So you see the great political possibility of the Black Cabinet, but you also see events happening in the early 1930s that horrify black America. The most famous of these cases was the Scottsboro boys scandal. On March 25th, 1931, a white boy comes off of a train, passing through Tennessee and the northern tips of Alabama. He comes off the train with a bloody head and claims that there was a big fight between black and white boys on his freight train that just passed through town. A posse forms. The train is stopped at the next station. The posse looks for and arrests the nine black boys who happen to be on the freight train. Now what the posse had not expected–and that would have been the end of the story, if that was all that had happened. What the posse had not expected to find were two white women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price. And they were found in the same freight car as some of the black boys.\nAs soon as Ruby Bates and Victoria Price are brought out, they see all of the police and the posse around them, and they’re with these black boys, they immediately size up the situation and declare they’ve been raped. This changes everything. The nine boys are accused of rape, become known as the Scottsboro boys. That’s where the, the court cases were being held, in Scottsboro, Alabama. They range in age from twenty to thirteen. There were one or two brother pairs, but they didn’t know each other, essentially. They all happened to be there. But word of the rape spreads like wildfire, and the next day, a mob of two thousand people forms at the jail where they’d been kept, urging the release of the boys so that, quote, “southern justice” could be handed out. The National Guard is called in immediately to keep them safe, which is remarkable in and of itself. The media does not help matters when it, when it comes to this particular case and the fact that, you know, the word of this vicious attack starts to spread. As they start the process of sending the boys to trial, the media, several quotes from different newspapers:\n“How much farther apart than night and day are the nine men who perpetrated these frightful deeds and a normal, kind hearted man who guards his little family and toils through the day?”\nOkay, not too offensive.\n“We still have savages abroad in the land, it seems. Let us have the solace of knowing that at least we have risen above this justice of savages.”\nA reference to the fact that, that the mob that wanted to kill the Scottsboro boys did not succeed. So with an editorial, giving a collective pat on the back to folks who did not resort to the same kind of savagery those boys did. But then you’d have editorials like this:\n“The rape was the most atrocious ever recorded in this part of the country, a wholesale debauching of society, so horrible in its details that all of the facts can never be printed. It savors of the jungle and the meanest African corruption.”\nThis is pre-trial media. Not very helpful for a defense case. At seven AM on the day of the first trial, thousands are lined up, trying to get a seat inside. And you–it’s hard–you can’t really tell from this image, [gestures up at the screen] but as the, the group goes this way, you can see it where the electric lines are cutting across, the line goes beyond the screen, beyond the, the actual image. Thousands are lined up hoping to get into the courthouse to see justice be enacted. Well, the boys had no money, they’re dirt poor. They have a defense attorney assigned to them who’s completely incompetent. They face an all-white jury. This is Alabama practice. No blacks are allowed in the jury rolls. And, within two weeks, the boys are indicted, tried, and all but one are sentenced to death. The nature of the defense, the speed of the trial, the fact that it was not a jury of their peers, angered African Americans and other parties. One party got–was moved to act very quickly, and that’s a group called the International Labor Defense, the ILD. The ILD is the legal arm of the Communist Party, and the ILD comes to the Scottsboro boys’–boys’ rescue immediately, claiming they were given an inadequate defense, and all these different things already cited. “This was not justice; you need to have a retrial.” \nNow the Communist Party in the USA has been around since 1919 or so. It’s been reaching out in sort of tentative ways to African Americans, with, with, you know, middling success really, increasing but middling. The NAACP’s been around a solid decade longer, so one would presume they’re right there rushing to defend them. Well, the fact is, no. The NAACP holds back. It holds back for a very important reason. It did not want to tar its own image by defending possible rapists and individuals who clearly did not adhere to the NAACP’s middle class ideals. This is really important to think about–to understand about the NAACP. It was from its very founding a middle class organization, dedicated to uplift in legalistic and political ways, assimilationist in its ideology, assimilating to white norms, white–so-called white middle class norms. The Scottsboro boys did not fit that model, and the NAACP was afraid of defending them for fear of a negative association.\nThe Communist Party sees this as an, an incredible opportunity, as a way to organize African Americans to become more sympathetic to the Communist Party. The Communist Party claimed that defending the Scottsboro boys was tantamount to fighting Southern racism and economic repression. So the Communists did not have super success with African Americans, because they were saying it’s all just about economics. And African Americans are saying, “Well, race kind of matters too in this country.”  The Scottsboro boys was the, was the window of opportunity for the Communist Party to broaden the scope of what it’s going to talk about as it relates to the African American experience. This transpires and the NAACP’s livid. It wants to be the organization really dedicated to addressing black concerns, and it’s very concerned that the Communist Party is involved, because the radicalism of the Communist Party was, was the, was about the last thing that’s going to be welcomed in a politically and socially conservative south.\nSo the NAACP doesn’t want to get involved because it–it would be tarnished by these boys’ activities, but they also recognized that with the Communist Party getting involved, it might be a death, a death sentence for these boys, because no one wants to hear from the Communists. And certainly as the Communists saw this as a way to open up a discussion about Southern racism, NAACP thought that, you know, “You’re, you’re pulling too many things together here, and trying to–basically you’re trying to develop racial insubordination in the South. This is not the way to go.”  The Scottsboro boys’ case because–becomes the cause célèbre of the 1930s. All of the issues we’ve talked about in this course so far are wrapped up in this history: manliness, civilization, culture, race, class, power, politics, and protest, they’re all here. The NAACP wanted more than anything else for a fair trial, and began to think, “Well, maybe we should get involved, because we might be able to win long-term advantage for African Americans by changing the way that trials are organized in the South,” since there were no blacks on the jury rolls; that might help further legal challenges and other movement opportunities down the–down the road.\nAnd the NAACP, you know on a quick side story, it knows the South very well, far better than the Communists did, who were mostly northern and urban at this point. And they reach out, the NAACP reaches out quietly to try to find lawyers for the Scottsboro boys who are competent. And they talked to George–Congressman George Huddleston, someone Alabamans considered a fiery left winger. But being liberal on white issues in the South did not necessarily translate into being a liberal on, quote, “black issues” here. Huddleston’s response to the quiet overture from the NAACP to support the Scottsboro boys’ defense, and I quote here,\n“I do not care whether they are innocent or guilty. You can’t understand how we Southern gentlemen feel about this–this question of relationship between Negro men and white women.”\nSimply put, the fact that the boys were on the freight–the same train as the two white girls was enough for Huddleston. He couldn’t touch it; it’s toxic. So the very basic chronology of the case is as follows. In 1931, the boys were arrested and convicted. In 1932, the Supreme Court overturns their convictions, saying the boys lacked adequate counsel. The fact that they’re still alive is really nothing short of a miracle, to be honest, and this is through the ILD’s efforts. In 1930–in February 1933, Ruby Bates, one of the two women who was found on the, the train, writes a letter declaring that the boys never touched her, that’s it’s all made up to protect their honor. A month later, a new trial begins and Samuel Leibowitz, an ILD attorney from New York, offers new evidence, but is considered to have been too tough on Victoria Price, the, the hold out. And to her, to her death, she claimed that this was–that she had been raped. Samuel Leibowitz presents new evidence, but was considered too tough on Victoria Price, thus violating Southern codes of honor. After one day of deliberation, Haywood Patterson, one of the Scottsboro boys, is found guilty. The prosecutor is saying openly, “Show them that Alabama justice cannot be bought and sold with Jew money from New York.”  This is the atmosphere of this case.\nNAACP blames the I–the Communist Party and the ILD for this conviction and that–and at that point realizes, or decides, they have to get involved if they’re gonna–if there’s going to be any hope of saving the rest of the boys. By 1935, the ILD and NAACP are formed together in a coalition to defend the boys. The Communist Party’s actions through all of this gave it a new base of intellectual and political support, within Harlem certainly, and black America in general. The Scottsboro boys’ mothers go on a world tour, supported by the Communist Party, to rally support for their sons, but also for workers’ plights, for workers’ plights around the world. And this is really–this point is important. The Communist Party makes major inroads in Harlem in particular, and you can see here in this image, this is a Scottsboro boys rally. And above my hand here there’s a big sign, a big poster, and the words you can make out there is talking about workers, and below it, Scottsboro boys. The Scottsboro boys themselves were, were vagabonds, hobos riding the rails, not uncommon during this period in time.\nThe Communist Party gets involved and as a way to sort of justify its involvement certainly, but also to rally other people around the cause of the Scottsboro boys, starts talking about them as, as workers. “This is what happens to workers in the United States under a capitalist system.”  The Scottsboro boys’ mothers are sent on these international world tours and they’re coached about how they’re going to talk about the worker’s plight, that the Communist Party cares about the workers of the world, and at the end, it’s a demonstration–it’s, it’s proven by the way that they’re advocating on behalf of their boys. As we start to learn more about the Scottsboro boys’ mothers’ tour, their world tours, we’re discovering the extent to which they were–manipulated is too strong a word–but how they were so highly scripted, the mothers that is, in terms of what they were supposed to say and not say and how they were being sort of handled at all times to make sure they stayed on message.\nNow, be that as it may, whether there was a level of manipulation here or not, the fact is the Communist Party is making incredible efforts on behalf of the Scottsboro boys, and the case is followed everywhere. And this actually–This is actually another image from Harlem. And this–I’m sorry you can’t really make it out here, but in a sense, this is a, a, a version now of what you’d see–what do they call those things in Time Square, those scrolling messages?  This is an update on the trial, when Patterson is found guilty. And there’s a commentary written down in chalk on this blackboard. People are gathered around it to find out what’s happening with the Scottsboro boys. Now what happens to them?  They get arrested in thirty-one, a new case in, in thirty-two. New cases in thirty-three, in thirty-three, a coalition in thirty-five. More hearings were held. Half the boys are released within a few years of the original incident. The other half languish behind bars, and the last one, the last Scottsboro boy is released, no longer a boy, in 1950.\nThe Scottsboro boys’ cause became the focal point of rallies across the country, in Harlem, as these images show, black college campuses. The Scottsboro boys’ cause became the sites of numerous political protests, and it really speaks to the new era or new philosophy about black politics during this era. These rallies are not the rallies of Garvey’s Back to Africa dreams. They’re not the silent protest marches, protesting against lynchings. The Scottsboro boys’ rallies, although they are rich in symbolism about the black–the black boys being workers, they also start to change political affiliations and movements on the ground. The Scottsboro boys’ rallies are, in so many ways, explicitly political. And these rallies, in this way, are new to the, to the scene as far–far as black Americans were concerned. And we’ll see how this is articulated in movement politics in–in our next lecture.\nSo taking together the Black Cabinet and the Scottsboro boys’ case, represent two sides of new political possibilities and new forms of political expression within black America: high politics and, for lack of a better phrase, the low politics, but also becoming topics of international conversation in terms of the black political situation. It’s a time of change. Oh one image here I forgot, before I tell a quick story. This is a poster. I mean the Scottsboro boys went on tour. In 1937, Willie Robinson and Eugene Williams came to New Haven to tell of the “horrors of hell and the pleasures of heaven.”  They came to the Emanuel Baptist Church to talk about their experiences in, in, Scotts–in the, in this case. It’s a local story in this way, but it’s part of a larger international phenomenon.\nChapter 5. The New Negro Alliance [00:38:07]\nNow I want to switch gears quickly from the Black Cabinet and the Scottsboro boys to talk of the New Negro Alliance. And I’ve got six minutes to tell what I used to do in a lecture, so hang on. The New Negro Alliance is a local articulation–this is local being Washington D.C.–of a larger national phenomenon, “Don’t buy where you can’t work” campaigns. “Don’t buy where you can’t work” campaigns. And it speaks to this new sort of form of political organizing that I’m suggesting is there with the Scottsboro boys and the, the Black Cabinet. So I’ve seen certain ways the New Negro Alliance pulling together embodying this new political philosophy. That’s why I want to tell this story very quickly. So there are these campaigns across the country where black–blacks would organize and say, “We’re not going to buy at the local thrift store, because they won’t employ black workers in this black neighborhood.\nIn August of 1933, this philosophy, this political movement, lands in D.C. where the owner of the local hamburger stand in black Washington, in, in the area, U Street district near Howard–Howard University, sort of the major black shopping enclave in the city. When the the guy who owns the hamburger grill fires the two black workers he has and hires two white kids in his place, wants to give them jobs. You know, everybody’s desperate for jobs since it’s the Great Depression. Within hours, a picket line’s formed at the hamburger stand, in the spirit of “Don’t buy where you can’t work.”  “We’re not going to patronize the store anymore, because they won’t let our type, our folks, black folks, work in this place.”  And this is a white owned store, if that part wasn’t clear. It should have been. Next thing you know, an–a group is organized. Two or three young men in college, just heading out of college, called the New Negro Alliance. One of these “Don’t buy where you can’t work” campaigns, and the city becomes electrified, black Wash–Washington that is, as New Negro–New Negro Alliance starts holding rallies, putting up posters. This is about staying out of People’s drugstores. You know, “They won’t employ blacks in the store, we’re not going to shop there any longer.”  To all fine–to all fair-minded people, justice is, is essential to Americanism. People’s is not just being racist; they’re being anti American.\nOther pair–posters would go up, fliers, again, about People’s Drugstore. “Don’t cheat on your race. Stay out of all People’s Drugstores.”  And so equating People’s Drugstores to an overseer whipping a poor black laborer. Now this is sort of the angry political art of a, you know, college age students. You know how you guys are. But the New Negro Alliance really became remarkable for the way that it brought in all these different sectors of, of black Washington. The most respectable members of Washington start joining picket lines. “People’s is unfair, no colored clerks in colored neighborhoods. Stay out.”  In short order, the New Negro Alliance starts getting success after success. The local dairy, People’s Drugstore, the cigar shop, all these places start to hire black workers, but there’s a hold out. The hold out is the Sanitary Grocery Company.\nThe Sanitary Grocery Company is the most important grocer in Washington D.C. during the era. It’s in black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods. Sanitary Grocery employed black workers, but as back office workers, stockroom boys, or janitors. These were the lowest paying jobs in the store and they were also the invisible jobs. New Negro Alliance comes up to them and says, you know, “The best paying jobs in your store, aside from being managers, are the cash register clerks. Why don’t you have any blacks in those positions?”  Sanitary Grocery gave its explanation, gave its reasons, and the New Negro Alliance puts up picket lines like this one. This is just one person, but starts putting up picket lines around Sanitary Grocery. Sanitary Grocery is not going to fold like these other places fold, and so starts its own political campaign with photographs of all the black workers, you know, dressed in nice uniforms, smiling for the camera. You know, “Sanitary Grocery works–you know, we work for Sanitary Grocery, support Sanitary Grocery.”  So they’re trading fliers, pamphlets, media bout–you know media shots for a–for a long time. It starts becoming a legal case.\nThe New Negro Alliance activists reach out to Howard University Law School. This is a pre–pro–prologue to the lecture next week. They reach out to Howard University Law School, and says to the law school students, “We need help organizing a court case here.”  And they start getting legal counsel from some of the law students and some of the law professors. Because it’s in D.C., a court case can become a Supreme Court case very quickly. The le–the issue–the legal issue, Sanitary Grocery Company is saying, “You cannot picket in front of our store. You’re not an employee.”  Just like this minister is picketing in front of People’s. He didn’t work at People’s. Sanitary Grocery is go–Sanitary Grocery is saying, “If you don’t–if you aren’t an employee of the company, you aren’t allowed to picket.”  New Negro Alliance said, “This is a free speech issue. We can picket.”  And it becomes a Supreme Court case.\nAnd in 1938, aided by the attorneys at–the attorneys in training and the, the faculty at the law school at Howard, the Supreme Court offers a decision in The New Negro Alliance versus Sanitary Grocery Company. And in that decision, it says that it’s protected speech, picketing that is. As long as you’re not interfering with the business at hand in terms of blocking the entrance, let’s say, it’s protected speech. And as such, these rallies, these–the work of the New Negro Alliance, is perfectly constitutional. It’s a major boost to the labor movement, as it happens, and it really makes great changes for the New Negro Alliance. It further, you know, underscores its importance. It also tells a really interesting story at the end. There’s a coda that I think is really humorous, but tells you something about the way these things operate.\nSanitary Grocery Company was the most important grocer in the city, and the last thing it wanted or needed was to be affiliated with a Supreme Court case that it lost, especially losing to African Americans. So the Sanitary Grocery Company ceases doing business under that name, and it becomes Safeway.\nFor those of you who know about Safeway, yes. I mean Safeways are actually disappearing now, because they’re being bought up by other conglomerates, but Safeway’s a major change–well, last I knew, still a major chain in–in California. And they’re still in the D.C. area, although they are slowly going away, being bought up by, last time I checked, which is a couple of years ago, it was–it was owned by the parent company of–that also owned Vond’s, Pavilion’s, Dominic’s, Carr’s, Randall’s, Tom Thumb’s, Grocery Works. I think it’s a big Canadian conglomerate. But this is, I mean it’s a humorous coda for those who know Safeway. There’s no mention anywhere of Safeway’s history, corporate history, of this actual–actually happening. Corporations don’t want to be tainted with, well, lack of success or really bad news. And in the case of the “Don’t buy where you can’t work” campaign in Washington D.C., they had both. And so Sanitary Grocery Company ceased to exist. It started operating under a new name. This is the potential of the new black politics: high politics, low politics, somewhere in the middle politics, and you’re going to start seeing in tomorrow’s lecture and in the, in the lectures over the next couple of weeks, a new kind of organizing mentality, operating at all levels, that starts to change the landscape of the American scene. Thanks so much.\n')
('african-american-studies', 'AFAM-162', 'lecture_12.txt', 'African American History: From Emancipation to the Present (2010)\nAFAM 162 - Lecture 12 - Depression and Double V (continued)\nChapter 1. The National Negro Congress [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  In the last lecture I set the terms for the week’s discussion, those being retrenchment and political advancement. I wanted to make clear on Monday’s lecture that the Scottsboro boys and the Black Cabinet represent two ends of a spectrum of political possibilities of black America in the 1930s. They are together articulating a new voice, a new vehicle to communicate responses to and articulations of possibilities, but coming from very different places in very different ways. The Scottsboro boys reaches back to a past of social control, certainly, but also representing in the Scottsboro boys case, in the way the Communist Party gets involved, that there’s a new mentality at work in black America, and new values in–or being seen–the, the, the accused being seen as commodities on a political battlefield. And the Black Cabinet represented the best possible world of new political insiderism at the national level, in a different way than the Scottsboro boys, serving as important symbols of blacks’ centrality to the political realm.\nNow I wanted to continue the discussion along those lines and to–these–I’m sorry–these are the themes for this week. I want to continue the discussion along these lines, but focusing upon the National Negro Congress, the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert, and the March on Washington movement. This–the events for this lecture are essentially the second half of the 1930s. But it’s important to realize, the things I was talking about in Monday’s lecture are overlapping, many of the events I’m talking about today. These are all happening in the course of the decade, but certainly at some point all happening at the same time.\nLet me start with the National Negro Congress. The National Negro Congress–for some reason, this is a lecture I wrote down a lot of notes for you guys, and I’m not sure really why. Maybe I was being generous. I don’t know. Anyway, the National Negro Congress has its start in the National Industrial League. It forms in 1933. This is a response to the development of, well, Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and agencies like the National Recovery–well, an early incarnation, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and how this organization was not going to care about setting wage, setting minimum wages for agricultural workers or for domestic workers. And two men get together, Robert C. Weaver and John P. Davis, and start–black men, and start testifying before Congress, before the Senate, saying, you know, “This is an abomination. You’re completely wri–writing out or, or disregarding those areas that have the most important or significant black involvement.”  The Negro Industrial League is a two man operation, but they fashion themselves as an umbrella group representing black interests across the country. It–It exists pretty much only in passing. Now the important part of it is that Robert C. Weaver is seen as doing such a great job, having recent–recently received his JD from Harvard, he gets incorporated into the federal government, and is one of the very first race advisors. So that’s where the Nation–the Negro Industrial League is important for bringing in one of its own into the federal bureaucracy. The other person, John P. Davis, remains an outsider, and we’ll be spending more time on Davis’s activities in the course of this lecture.\nDavis organizes, in the wake of the Negro Industrial League’s collapse, the Joint Committee for National Recovery. It lasts only for two years. It too fashions itself as an umbrella organization representing blacks’ needs from across the country. Now this is a self representation. I mean these were not, you do not–You do not have all sorts of black run organizations, running to John P. Davis and the Joint Committee for National Recovery, which is essentially him and an office and a couple of figurehead people. Davis–well they aren’t running to Davis, because one, this is a new kid on the block basically. They’re still looking at organizations like, you know, churches, business associations, the NAACP, for example, but the Joint Committee for National Recovery does at least one important thing before it collapses, and it organizes a conference at Howard University. And this is a conference that is dedicated to trying to understand the economic plight of African Americans during the Great Depression and the New Deal.\nNow it’s just a conference, but it brings–but it’s remarkable that it brings together people from a wide range of political backgrounds. It brings together labor organizers, agricultural workers, domestic workers, you know, people who are doing work on the ground. It brings together intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois, who’s becoming a Marxist and talking economic cooperatives along race lines, something actually in some ways looking similar to Booker T. Washington’s ideologies. It brings together leaders of the Communist Party, the Workers’ Party, the Socialist Party. It brings together people from the federal government, like Robert C. Weaver now, all asking the question: what is the status of the Negro in, in the New Deal?  And the result of this conference was–well, many things came out of it. One, scathing attack on the New Deal for the way it ignored blacks’ conditions on the ground, in ways I outlined briefly on Monday. It launched an investigation into communist activities at Howard University, Howard University then essentially being funded by the federal government, and essentially now still receiving most of its support from the federal government. An investigation was launched into the communist activities at Howard, and certainly there were communists on the faculty at Howard and certainly socialists as well, and certainly a lot of sympathizers. So there was an attempt to silence and actually shut down the university as a result of this conference. And most importantly, it establishes a group called the National Negro Congress. I forgot that slide. Okay, those are the notes for what I just told you.\nThe National Negro Congress actually does turn into that kind of umbrella organization that the Negro Industrial League and the Joint Committee for National Recovery all aspired to be. The National Negro Congress forms out of a call, I mean the Howard University Conference, “We need to organize a, a national political action group,” and it becomes the National Negro Congress, formed in 1936. The congress convenes for the first time in Chicago in thirty-six, where it’s met where–with police harassment, due to alleged communistic, communist participation. A. Philip Randolph, who we’ll be talking about more towards the end of the lecture, but for now, just to know the most important–Bless you.\nThe most important labor leader in black America, is elected its first president. And the National Negro Congress establishes–sorry I’m all off on my slides here today. Excuse me. It establishes a slate that’s concerning civil rights, women’s rights, labor’s rights, aid to farmers and sharecroppers. It calls for an anti-lynching law; it calls for voting rights, educational opportunities, social and unemployment insurance, and opposition to war and fascism. Civil rights, women’s rights, labor’s rights, aid to farmers and sharecroppers, anti-lynching law, voting rights, education opportunities, social un–and unemployment insurance and an oppression to war and fascism. If you think back to a few weeks earlier in the course, a large part of this slate that the National Negro Congress calls for is identical to the slate, to the manifesto, that the Niagara Movement calls for some thirty years earlier, not quite thirty years. The point is, a lot of the issues haven’t changed, despite some real changes in those thirty, thirty-one years, excuse me.\nNow the National Negro Congress was not just made up of black folks getting together calling for a slate of a progressive future. It is, as the slide up here indicates, a cross section of black groups and white labor, of all different kinds of groups as far as black business bureaus, black churches, black labor organizations. The congress actively courts white labor in this regard, especially the Congress of Industrial Organization, and it sets out this agenda for change on the ground. It has, more than anything else, a labor orientation, despite even business groups being involved. It’s going to change things on the ground. And the person organizing–sort of–A. Philip Randolph is the president, but the person doing the work on a day-to-day basis is John P. Davis. He was there at the Negro Industrial League, there at the Joint Committee for International Recovery, and he’s really running the National Negro Congress. And he runs it for the length of the NNC’s existence, which is not quite a decade.\nNow one of the first things the Congress does successfully, aside from just meeting, is establish a Southern Negro Youth Congress, essentially the youth arm of the Congress. The Southern Negro Youth Con–Congress had its inaugural conference half a year late in February 1937 in Richmond, Virginia, and it makes its headquarters there for a number of years. With the guidance of the Southern Negro Youth Conference leaders, it becomes a permanent organization and almost immediately organizes five thousand tobacco workers into the Tobacco Stemmers and Laborers Industrial union. Very soon after, an SNYC leads a sit down strike in–at a Virginia Tobacco Company and garn–and, and gets wage increases of twenty to thrity-three percent. This is remarkable. The Southern Negro Youth Congress, these are, these are people your age and a little bit older, going down to Richmond, Virginia, the heart of the Confederacy, and organizing black workers into a union and getting wages–wage increases for them. It’s nothing really short of astonishing.\nBy 1939, when the third annual conference of the SNYC gathers in Birm–gathers, they meet in Birmingham, Alabama. Over six hundred delegates are in attendance. It’s the largest conference to date. The themes of the conference revolved around citizenship, equal opportunity, and black culture. These are themes that by now must be familiar to all of you. I’ve been talking about it during this course, after all. Again, themes from the Niagara Movement, but in this case with the students, a different type of cultural emphasis. I think a hangover, in a sense, from the Harlem Renaissance. But the Southern Negro Youth Congress was not another middle-class black venture. I’m thinking too that’s sort of the cultural producers of the Renaissance. It espoused a democratic socialist vision. It was militantly interracial. It offered its full support to the Congress Industrial Organization, that breakaway set of labor unions that actually welcomed black workers. And, this is the most important part, it’s very quietly Communist. The Southern Negro Youth Congress moves its headquarters from Richmond down to Birmingham and establishes a watchdog presence in the Deep South. It wages suffrage campaigns, you know, trying to get people to vote, anti-poll tax campaigns. It tries to fight against police brutality.\nNow the Southern Negro Youth Congress is important because of its Communist involvement, certainly, but also because you can see it as a preface to the civil rights activities that defined Birmingham some twenty years later, and that as we’ll see next week, you start seeing a lot of these kinds of activities in other places throughout the South, through other organizations. Now I’ll ex–expand upon this point later on. It’s very important. The Southern Negro Youth Congress is but one example that forces, if you think about it, forces a re-periodization of the Civil Rights Movement. I’ll leave that alone there for a moment. Well, the SNYC begins to fade as we get into the 1940s. Its male leaders go off to fight; its female leaders do not remain youthful. I mean, neither do the men of course, but the women are still at home. It’s no longer a “youth congress.”  They’re not regenerating themselves. And the whispering about its linkage to the Communist Party really prevents it from becoming a major political force after the Soviet-Nazi pact in 1939, when the soviet–when Hitler and Stalin get together, saying, “We won’t fight against each other,” which alienates a lot of people who were supporting the Communist Party in the United States.\nMeanwhile, back in the National Negro Congress, I’ll roll back the clock a few years. Randolph, A. Phil–A. Philip Randolph, he’s the president, is hearing more whispering about Communist involvement in the National Negro Congress, and he’s not happy about it. He fights–he denies it at first, goes, “No, we are, you know, we are an independent organization. Even though we’ve modeled ourselves, modeled ourselves after Communist ideologies as far as developing a Popular Front of all people from different kinds of places coming together to fight towards one goal, we are not Communists.”  But then it becomes clear that Communists have infiltrated the National Negro Congress, mainly through the Congress of Industrial Organization. So white labor organizers, Randolph concludes, are bringing Communism into this organization, and he wants no part of it. Randolph, after denying it for a while, goes to the national convention in 1940 where he’s going to stand up in front of the Congress, the National Negro Congress and resign, and resign with fire, talking about how the Communists do not have our best interests at heart. He’s basically booed off the stage. I mean, the communists are now taking control of the Negro Congress. And John P. Davis, where is he through all of this?  Well, he’s–he’s a communist actually. And so, you know, he’s caught in a rock and a hard place, but sides with the Congress. And that’s where he, that’s where he continues to reside for a handful more years.\nChapter 2. The Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert [00:16:06]\nNow that’s in 1940, and Randolph’s about to go off and start something quite different in response to his departure from the Nation–National Negro Congress. And we’ll get to that towards the end of the lecture. While all of this is going on–all of this meaning the National Negro Congress becoming organized, having its conferences, turning more towards Communism and then Randolph breaking from it–you have a series of events happening on the cultural front, cultural and political front, that sort of galvanizes black opinion and leads to a new set of political possibilities, and that’s the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday concert in 1939. Marian Anderson, black woman, regarded as one of the world’s greatest living contraltos. She’s–she sings opera. Her case is well known, partly for her international stature, partly for the other high profile whites who are involved in it, and partly for the symbolic significance attached to the controversy. Let me give you the history behind it, and the controversy, and explain its significance.\nHoward University School of Music had regularly been scheduling Marian Anders–Marian Anderson to come back from Europe. She was born in the U.S. but couldn’t establish a career in the U.S. She goes off to Europe and becomes a fan–a, a superstar in Europe. But Howard School of Music starts–is schedule–as her star is rising in Europe, is scheduling her to come back to the U.S. to give conf–concerts, and they’ve been on campus. As her popularity rises, they can’t house her on campus any more, and in 1936 and thirty-seven, the Howard concert had been moved to a local black high school auditorium. By 1938, Marian Anderson’s fees are such, and the demand is such, they need a larger venue in order to spon–to hold the concert. They went into the black commercial district, which is right next to Howard, went to a theater that was bigger than the black high school auditorium, had it there. In 1939, the fees are greater, the demand is greater. Where are we going to have a concert? \nThe School of Music goes to the Daughters of the American Revolution, the DAR. The Daughters of the American Revolution, a social political organization–I think more social in this moment until it becomes politicized–of women who can date back their lineage to people who fought in the Revolutionary War. At that time and really only until the last ten or fifteen years, a very white organization and very conservative organization. And they manage Constitution Hall, which is the largest venue in the city. It’s still there today. Well, they go to the Daughters of the American Revolution, the School of Music does, “We’d like to have Marian Anderson performing in, in Constitution Hall. Would you let her sing there?”  Now the DAR maintained a strictly segregated policy. Now in D.C. theaters, it was quite common to have segregated audiences. If blacks were allowed in, they’d only be allowed up in the balcony. You could have blacks on stage always, because they “dance so well,” they “sing so beautifully” as the stereotype goes. But DAR was different: no blacks in the audience period, and no blacks on stage. It was an all white venue all the time.\nThe Howard University School of Music, rebuffed by this, goes to a local white high school, which has a much larger auditorium than the black high school that had been used before and the Rialto, and it’s rebuffed again. Black leaders in the District then form the Marian Anderson Citizens Committee to fight these decisions. It’s a coalition of local clergy, teachers, civic and fraternal organizations, trying to basically knock down these doors. Behind the scenes, however, a man named Charles Houston, a lawyer at this point for the NAACP–he’s the first general counsel. He had been brought to Howard a decade earlier to reorganize its law school and starts teaching the first civil rights law classes in the country, the law school does. Charles Houston gets involved behind the scenes, as well as the NAACP. They start organizing mass meetings, letters of support start being sent in to these different organizations, and they’re focusing on the white high school. They go to–They’re going to the, the Board of Education. The Board of Education says, “Okay, we’ll, we’ll come to a compromise on this. We will allow Marian Anderson to perform at the white high school, Central High. We’ll let it be integrated. But this will be a one-time event and you may not use this”–you, the citizens organizing the committee, and quietly, Charles Houston–“you may not use this as a precedent from challenging separate but equal educational systems in the District of Columbia.” \nWell, the fact is, that’s what Houston was trying to do the whole time, once he got involved, because this is a great way to break down the color line in the school system, using Marian Anderson as a symbolic vehicle. It’s a compromise the protestors refused–refused to accept and the School of Board called their bluff [laughs[–the Board of Education called their bluff. So the NAACP and Charles Houston go to the White House. They go to the White House via Mary McLeod Bethune, talked about on Monday, who gets them to have an audience with Eleanor Roosevelt; Eleanor Roosevelt who’s a member of the DAR, incredibly popular syndicated-syndicated columnist. Approaches the DAR and they tell her, “No, we’re not breaking this policy,” and she resigns in protest and writes a very famous column about this, and her embarrassment for the DAR. Eleanor Roosevelt talks to Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, himself, like Eleanor Roosevelt, considered a “friend of the race,” as what the phrase was at the time. Harold Ickes steps in and arranges a concert on Easter Sunday in 1939 for Marian Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial. As the Secretary of the Interior, he, he, he controlled the federal land and controlled what happened on the National Mall.\nOn the day in question, Ickes steps up to the microphone and introduces Marian Anderson. One prominent journal remarked after the fact that, I’m quoting here, “The brevity and force of his speech was destined to rival Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.”  Now whether that’s true or not is a–well I don’t think we remember this speech, so it didn’t really rival the Gettysburg Address. But it is short and it is powerful. This is what he says here, one excerpt of what he says:\nHarold Ickes:  “Genius, like justice, is blind. For Genius, with the tip of her wings, has touched this woman, who, if it had not been for the great mind of Jefferson, if it had not been for the great heart of Lincoln, would not be able to stand among us today as a free individual in a free land. Genius. Genius draws no color line.”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  You start hearing a plane flying overhead there. It was something of a circus atmosphere. He says,\n“Genius, like justice, is blind. For Genius has touched with the tip of her wings this woman, who, if it had not been for the great mind of Jefferson, if it had not been for the great heart of Lincoln, would not be able to stand among us today as a free individual in a free land. Genius. Genius draws no color line.”\nIt’s a powerful statement coming from a representative of the federal government. Now four hours before Ickes steps to the microphone, four hours before the concert begins, people start arriving at the National Mall and the Lincoln Memorial. And what they find there is really quite remarkable. D.C. is a very segregated city during this era. What they find is an absence, an absence of “colored only” sections, an absence of, you know, “White section. No colored allowed.”  Seventy-five thousand people crowd the Mall, and it may not sound like a dramatic number to you in our day of, you know, millions showing up at the Mall, but this is historic. And it’s also opera, which is not known as the people’s music, right?  Seventy-five thousand people crowd the Mall to hear Anderson’s performance, and an untold number of people listen to the performance on radio around the country, aired live. Planes are circling overhead trying to understand the scene that’s going on there.\nThis is a famous image: Marian Anderson, long fur coat, singing just with piano accompanying her. Steps up to the microphone and in a powerful yet dignified rebuke to the DAR, Anderson simply begins her concert in this way:(singing) “My country, ‘tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing;” She sounded a bit like that, maybe a bit better. Eloquent, powerful, subtle, undeniable. She is in this moment claiming the country as much–It belongs as much to her as it belongs to the Daughters of the American Revolution. Everybody there got it. She didn’t have to say, you know, “I’m so glad to be here today. It’s lovely. You know, D.C., how are you?” \n[students laughing]\nYou didn’t have to do that kind of stuff; simply declared, “This is my country too.”  And in fact, as an aside, it’s–the inauguration of Barack Obama, something, I don’t know if I’ll talk about it or not at the end of the class, but when Aretha Franklin stands up to sing My Country, ‘Tis of Thee–she, I mean, it’s a, culturally a very dense inauguration. I mean, all inaugurations are rich with symbolism, but this one was rather remarkable. She was singing My Country, ‘Tis of Thee, for the, you know, that people would get it in the audience, but there’s a whole other level of understanding for those people who know this story and what Marian Anderson did with this particular exhortation. And I, I’ve heard, if you watched the HBO special the day before the inauguration, they explained some of this. I didn’t see it; but, and many people didn’t. The significance of Aretha Franklin’s performance of that particular song was lost on many folks, but it was a reckoning back to this moment.\nThe moment’s important, not just because, you know, it’s a classy way of being a civil rights protestor, but it’s important for these different reasons. With Eleanor Roosevelt and Harold Ickes giving their very public support to the, the Citizens Committee for Marian Anderson, and for the right for her to sing at the DAR, it suggests to African Americans that the federal government, at the highest levels, in the White House, “really does care about us.”  They’d been working on the Black Cabinet. That’s–They’ve been going out and changing things. We’re now as a group beginning to vote for Democrats anyway, through–because of FDR. And now the First Lady, the Secretary of Interior, are saying, “Genius draws no color line.”  Of course, it’s the symbolism wrapped up in performing under the protective gaze of the Great Emancipator. That’s not lost on anybody either. But it’s also felt on the very local level in ways that’s lost to history often.\nWhen I was working on my first book, my dissertation in fact, I was interviewing a longtime D.C. resident. He was then about eighty years old. And we were just talking about this era, you know, in Washington, D.C. and, and what it meant to be black and struggle with the color line. And this concert comes up, and he said something I’ve never forgotten. And he says, this is a quote, it’s burned into my brain: “After that concert”–and he was there, I should say. “After that concert, everything looked different in America as far as blacks were concerned.”  “After that concert, everything looked different in America as far as blacks were concerned.”    Now he’s not talking literally, because the day after Marian Anderson sang, it wasn’t like if you were black, you could go into a local restaurant that’s not in the black section of town, or at Union Station, the only other place blacks could go for a public restaurant. You couldn’t go in someplace else and get a meal. You all of a sudden couldn’t get a job that was denied to you, you know, the week before. So in terms of literal bread and butter issues, there’s no change. But at the level of symbolic possibilities, at the level of what blacks can articulate and think as maybe achievable, fundamental change happens with this concert.\nNow it’s also important because the public outcry surrounding Mary Anderson’s concert is happening in the context of a larger battle of a war or rhetoric against the Nazi doctrines of racial supremacy. So you can’t just understand this concert in the context of an event that happened in Washington, D.C., or an event that happened in the U.S. It’s an event that has global ramifications, especially for the way in which the U.S. federal government is struggling against a war of words with Nazi and–Nazi and fascist regimes. “The U.S. didn’t have a leg to stand on,” the Nazis would say, “because they’re just as racist as we are.”  This is very important for the U.S. as it really does enter the Second World War and continues on through the Cold War, something I’ll touch down upon once or twice, I’m sure, in this course. As the U.S. becomes an international power, which is this part of the story, the 1920s and thirties and forties especially, its domestic politics become scrutinized much more closely. World War II, which we’re on the cusp of getting involved in, is a war to stop the spread of fascism, but if the U.S. can’t handle its own fascistic tendencies internal, it’s a war of hypocrisy.\nSo you start seeing there, in the Scottsboro boys, reaching back to Monday, and the way they use it as cultural markers for the Communists, Marion Anderson being used as a cultural marker of democratic possibilities, blacks being used as cultural markers of political possibilities, of what this country is supposed to be for everybody, and what the country’s supposed to be for African Americans, and what the country’s supposed to be for the world. Now this affords–oh, one other, this is a very famous image, of course, of Marian Anderson. There’s another image that I show up here just for the sake of a, a quick side lesson on how you read images. There’s a way in which, you know, we–we are, in our minds’ eye, we are here sitting just below her right shoulder, and we see dignitaries at the micro–at the, at the stand.\nThis image I dug up tells a very different story. Except for–I’ll use the mouse here–except for this area here, which is cordoned off for reasons I honestly don’t know, everything else you see, except for that tree line, going off to, beyond the Reflecting Pool, are people, sitting there in an integrated audience, seventy-five thousand people. It just sort of gives you a different sense of the way this might have felt if you were actually there. And because it’s harder to make out Marian Anderson, I’m as–I’m assuming that’s why this is not one of the more famous iconic pictures. You just, here’s just somebody’s back standing in front of an audience. But it really was quite a visual spectacle, and I think offers ways for you to think about how you read images, for instance, perspective being very important.\nChapter 3. A. Philip Randolph and the March on Washington Movement [00:33:38]\nNow I was talking before the little caveat, I was talking about political symbolism and the roles and the ways in which African Americans were political footballs. And then I wanted to transition to a story that helps us understand how blacks start using this to their great advantage and that’s the story of A. Philip Randolph. A. Philip Randolph, whose name has come up several times already in the course, and I’m going to devote the rest of the lecture to him quickly, he is one of the most important transitional political figures in African American history. He was born in 1889, dies in 1979. I mean, the ranges of what happens in his lifetime is really astonishing. But here’s a person who’s involved in the political scene in the nineteen-teens and twenties, taking a frontline argument on issues. And he’s there in 1941 at a moment of, of powerful symbolic importance, I’ll be talking about in a moment. And he’s there in 1963 when King steps up to the microphone and delivers his “Dream” speech. Incredibly important political person. Helps us navigate from a period of Booker T. Washington political power, ideology of accommodation, and through his consistent socialist politics–Randolph couldn’t stand Communists but was an ardent socialist–transitions African American political voice to a very different kind–different kind of voice.\nNow there’s three phases to Randolph’s career through 1941. In 1914, he moves to New York City, becomes witness, well part of and witness to the Great Migration and sees the way it transforms that particular urban site. He sees the NAACP and the National Urban League as people–organizations fighting out for resources–fighting over resources, certainly affecting workers’ lives by their policies, but not really at the workers’ level. NAACP being very much a top-down organization, with assimilationist and middle-class norms. The National Urban League trying to help people on the ground, but, you know, in the pocket of corporate–corporations and helping basically break up labor unions. And Randolph says, “But what about the workers themselves?”  And so he starts looking around for different ways to get involved in workers’ movements, labor movements. In 1917, he declares himself a Socialist, urges blacks to resist the U.S. draft and to confine their fighting to the domestic front. He can’t stand Du Bois’s call to close our–close ranks. And around the same time he, along with another black socialist named Chandler Owen, start publishing a mess–a magazine called The Messenger. Through The Messenger, Randolph calls for a bold, black socialist leadership, calls for radicals who would not be afraid to challenge accepted notions of, of how a U.S. society should operate. If Washington is on this part of a spectrum, and Du Bois is over here on the opposite side, Randolph’s even further beyond Du Bois politically.\nHe and Owen are characterized as Bolsheviks by members of Congress. They’re investigated by the Department of Justice, and they declare in response, “We would be glad to see a Bolshevik government substituted in the South in place of your Bourbon, reactionary, vote stolen, misrepresentative, democratic regime.”  That sounds like, you know, Black Panther talking here, doesn’t it?  In 1919, Randolph says that he’s thankful for the Russian Revolution, the greatest achievement of the twentieth century. But when the American version–when the American Community Party is organized in twenty-one, Randolph remains a Socialist and dedicates the rest of his life really to preventing social–Communists from controlling or representing black America. By the mid-twenties, The Messenger as a journal is actually not doing that well. Randolph still casting about for ways in which to connect with black workers, and a labor union is being–is organized, and recognized that Randolph really has the voice that they need to be heard in a larger–a larger scene, and that’s the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids.\nIn twenty-five, 1925, Randolph’s recruited to head the union of Sleeping Car Porters, and then when organized, trying to get the American Federation–the Pullman Company, people who run the trains, own the trains, to recognize that union, and then the American Federation of Labor to recognize that union. Efforts are made to get better working conditions and higher wages from Pullman. Pullman refuses both and tries blackballing Randolph, tries to, you know, crush him. Randolph becomes very unpopular with black and white groups alike for his radical stances, but the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters does earn the–gather the support of the NAACP, the Urban League, and eventually the American Federation of Labor. It wins partial recognition in 1926, and in 1929, more recognition, but still not full recognition. A decade later after starting this battle, Randolph does win for the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids full recognition from the AFL and, a year later, from the Pullman Porters–the Pullman porters–I mean from the AFL, ex–from the Pullman Company. The wages go up, job security goes up, benefits go up. The Pullman porters actually become a great vehicle to attain middle-class status for a segment of black America. In fact, the Pullman porters, the U.S. post, the military, over the course of the twentieth century, are the three great ways for black Americans to transition to middle-class status.\nWith Randolph’s victories with the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids getting fully recognized finally in thirty-six and thirty-seven, he is seen as, without doubt, the most important black labor leader in the country. This is why he’s selected to run the National Negro Congress. There’s nobody else who has his access, who has his power, and his influence. But as you know, Randolph is a staunch anti-Communist, and as the National Negro Congress develops further, he realizes there’s no place for him any more in that organization. So Randolph starts thinking of a different way to achieve justice for blacks, full citizenship rights and decent jobs for blacks in the United States. The National Negro Congress is not going to be the vehicle. What Randolph sees is that as the U.S. war industry starts to develop, as it’s arming Europe–Western Europe, or the Allies, I should say–as the U.S. war machine, industrial war machine develops, these are the best paying jobs in the country, as far as, you know, factory work is concerned, and blacks can’t get those jobs. They can work–they can push a broom in the factory, but they can’t roll steel, or whatever you do in a munitions factory.\nFactories run overtime. There’s money to be made hand over fist. Blacks couldn’t get those jobs. There’s movements being made to increase the size of the army, a powerfully segregated army. Randolph says, “Where do we fit in, in all of this? We’re second class in the factory and in the military.”  Randolph and a group of other leaders go to Franklin Roosevelt, September of 1940, with a seven point plan, that, I mean, I’m not going to go into now in the interests of time, but essentially calling for the desegregation or the integration of the U.S. military, calling for access to all jobs in the defense industries, essentially anti-discrimination policies. The plea is ignored. FDR, always being afraid of losing his coalition of southern Democrats who would be upset by any sort of racial progressive politics. Blacks are going into the army certainly, but they’re going into all black units, trained in separate places, trained most often by white officers. A lot of the same story that you heard in World War I. Domestic hiring situation is a joke. Blacks are not being hired in factory floor jobs. As white men go off to fight in the war, white women are brought into the factory, a radical change for women’s possibilities, certainly, but black men and black women are not getting these jobs.\nSo in January of 1941, Randolph proposes–I mean he’s no longer with the National Negro Congress. He’s broken from them. He proposes a March on Washington, and he demands that something be done regarding black access to jobs, and of course for the integration of the military. And he calls at first for ten thousand blacks to march on Washington. And as that met with enthusiasm, he calls for fifty thousand. Then he calls for one hundred thousand blacks to march on Washington that summer, on July 1st, if there is no change. It doesn’t seem like bluster. Things have changed, on the ground and in the air. As we head into the summer, into June, people in D.C. are getting concerned. “My god, what if one hundred thousand negroes come into this city and are angry?  What are we going to do?”  And Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, dispatches two of his most trusted sort of network political operatives to talk with A. Philip Randolph to calm him down. He sends Fiorello La Guardia, then the mayor of New York City, liberal on race issues. “Please talk to Randolph and tell him to call off this march.”  No dice. He sends his wife, the most powerful proponent on these issues in his pocket, he sends his wife. Randolph goes, “No dice. I’m not, I’m not canceling this march.”  Finally FDR says, “Okay, Mr. Randolph, come to see me.” \nIt’s a week before the march is set to go off. Randolph goes into the White House, meets with Roosevelt. And Roosevelt says, Roosevelt says, “If you call off the march, I’ll issue an executive order with ‘teeth’ in it,” as the word was. And Randolph says, “Okay.”  Roosevelt signs Executive Order 8802 on June 25th, 1941. It says there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color or national origin, and it’s the duty of the employers and of labor organizations to provide for the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries without discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin. It sets up a Fair Employment Practices Committee that would be a watchdog organization. It couldn’t do anything but give bad publicity to a factory that’s not hiring black workers. But people didn’t want to be, to be seen somehow as un-American, so FE–FEPC could make some changes along the margins, along the edges of things.\nYou’ll notice that the executive order did not end segregation in the military. It’s simply calling for industry changes. Randolph doesn’t win that battle and won’t win it for a while. Now blacks hail the Executive Order 8802 as the most significant order since the Emancipation Proclamation. This is a new era, and it’s not a new era just because of what the President’s calling for. It’s on the ground, what happens is a little, a little messier. It doesn’t immediately integrate all industries. But what’s really important is the linkage now, the symbolic possibilities and real political change, and that is a prominent leader of the African American community called the President’s bluff; was called into the White House and they negotiated, face to face, to find a resolution. That’s one of the things, once the genie’s out of that bottle, it can’t go back in. So black access to the White House is now direct, to the President. Presidents from this point on cannot afford to ignore black leaders in the way they have been doing since the founding of the Republic. So you have in A. Philip Randolph and the March on Washington moment the merging of the symbolic politics of possibility and the real politics of possibility. And it is a merger that would go on to define the civil rights movement that we know about so well over the next thrity or forty years. Thank you very much.\n')
('african-american-studies', 'AFAM-162', 'lecture_13.txt', 'African American History: From Emancipation to the Present (2010)\nAFAM 162 - Lecture 13 - The Road to Brown and Little Rock\nChapter 1. A Tallying of the State of Segregation in 1951 [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  I want to start with, I guess for lack of a better word, two vignettes. One, and it really is lack of a better word, vignette is actually a series of, of statistics. You don’t need to keep them from your notes, but I want you to understand them from an impressionistic point of view. These–this is a tallying of the state of segregation in 1951. It’s a random point in time in the South. In May of 1951, the state of Texas did not allow interracial boxing matches. Florida did not allow white and black students to use the same editions of textbooks. In Alabama, a white woman was not allowed to take care of a black male patient. North Carolina required separate washrooms in its factories. South Carolina required them in its cotton mills. Four other states required them in their mines. In six states–and there’s a, I’m going to be reading a list in numbers of states. They’re overlapping in different combinations, I’m quite sure–in six states, white and black prisoners could not be chained together.\nIn seven states, parks, playgrounds, bathing and fishing and boating facilities, amusement parks, race tracks, pool halls, circuses, theaters and public halls were all segregated. Ten states required separate waiting rooms for bus and train travelers. Fourteen states required black passengers to ride in the back of buses and streetcars. Some other combination of fourteen states segregated railroad passengers on trips within their borders. Some other combination of fourteen states required mental–segregated mental patients. Some seventeen states required segregation of public schools. Four other states permitted the practice if local communities wished it. And in, and in Washington DC, the custom had prevailed for nearly ninety years. In eleven, in eleven states–and this one I find is actually breathtaking for the absurdity of all of this, or maybe even the passion for all of this–in eleven states or eleven states operated separate schools for the blind. So even if you could not see each other, you could not be in the same space if you were white and if you were black. It’s a thorough going segregation across many different lines, many different vectors, of how you operate as a citizen in the world. \nChapter 2. Melba Beals’ Memoir: Warriors Don’t Cry [00:02:51]\nNow that’s 1950, fifty-one. I want to read to you an excerpt from the memoir Warriors Don’t Cry by Melba Beals, who was one of the, who would become one of the, would become one of the Little Rock Nine, who’d deseg–desegregate Central High School. We’ll be talking–I’ll talk a little bit about Central High School in Monday’s lecture. We’re actually chronologically not getting up to that point in today’s lecture. But I want to read to you an excerpt from 1954–of events that happened in 1954–to help underscore, undergird the extent to which the kind of higher level organizing and political work and legal affairs that will be the bulk of today’s lecture, to underscore the way in which these things really made themselves manifest on the ground. So Melba Beals writes very early in her book, reflecting back to when she was, I believe, twelve years old. She’s walking back home from school on the day that Brown v., Brown v., Brown versus the Board of Education decision had been announced. And teachers all–the teachers told their students, black teachers, black students, “Go straight home. Don’t take any shortcuts. Just go straight home.”\n“As I entered the persimmon field, I sank deep into my thoughts, but a few steps past the big tree at the front of the path, I heard a rustling sound. I stood perfectly still, looking all around. I didn’t see a soul. Suddenly, as I came near to the end of the field, a man’s gravel voice snatched me from the secret place in my head.\n‘You want a ride, girl?’ He didn’t sound at all like anybody I knew. There is was again, that stranger’s voice calling out to me. ‘Want a ride?’\n‘Who is it?’ I asked, barely able to squeeze the words out.\n‘I got candy in the car, lots of candy.’\nI crept forward, and then I saw him—a big white man, even taller than my father, broad and huge, like a wrestler. He was coming toward me fast. I turned on my heels and fled in the opposite direction, back the way I had come.\n‘You’d better come on and take a ride home, you hear me girl?’\n‘No sir!’ I yelled, ‘No, thank you,’ but he kept coming.\nMy heart was racing almost as fast as my feet. I couldn’t hear anything except for the sound of my saddle shoes pounding the ground and the thud of his feet close behind me. That’s when he started talking about ‘niggers’ wanting to go to school with his children and how he wasn’t going to stand for it. My cries for help drowned out the sound of his words, but he laughed and said it was no use because nobody would hear me. I was running as fast as I could. The lace on my shoe came untied and my feet got tangled. As I hit the ground, I bit down hard on my tongue. I felt his strong hands clutch my back. I bolted up, struggling to get away. He pulled me down and turned me on my back. I looked up into his face, looming close above me like the monster on a movie screen. I struggled against him but he was too strong. He slapped me hard across the face. I covered my eyes with my hands and waited for him to strike me again. Instead, I felt him squirm against me, and then I saw him taking his pants down. In my house, private parts were always kept private. I couldn’t figure out what he was doing, but I knew it had to be bad. I scratched and kicked and thrashed against him with every ounce of strength I could muster. His huge fists smashed hard against my face. I struggled to push him back and to keep the dark curtain of unconsciousness from descending over me.\n‘I’ll show you niggers the Supreme Court can’t run my life,’ he said, as he–as his hand ripped at my underpants. A voice inside my head told me I was going to die, but there was nothing I could do about it. White men were in charge.”\nSomeone comes to her rescue within about four or five seconds of this moment, before she’s actually raped. One of her classmates she didn’t really know that well knocks the guy over the head with a brick and she’s able to escape to safety. Thus begins her journey towards becoming one of the Little Rock Nine. These are the memories of a twelve year old.\nNow I want to set that stage about systemic segregation and the ways in which people were, I mean from my personal perspective, were driven mad by the Supreme–Supreme Court decision of fifty-four. To sort of underscore, for lack of a better phrase, the intensity of the moment, a period of profound ambiguity in this country and a period of profound change for blacks as well as whites, conservatives as well as liberals. And over the course of today’s lecture and really Monday’s lecture, we’re going to start canvassing the ways in which–[student sneezes] Bless You–the ways in which this period of, of incredible instability in the United States was made, was felt on many different levels, in different ways. So much of today’s lecture is context, for much of the, for going across the 1940s up to Brown v. Board.\nChapter 3. The Fair Employment Practices Committee [00:07:57]\nNow I ended the last lecture before the midterm talking about A. Philip Randolph’s March on Washington Movement, his bluff with FDR, FDR’s issuing of Executive Order 8802, and the creation of the FEPC. I was trying to cram a lot of things into the lecture. Give me two minutes to talk about the FEPC very quickly and move us into the 1940s.\nThe FEPC, Fair Employment–Fair Employment Practices Commission–Committee, held high profile hearings in major cities about segregation in defense industry factories. But it was essentially powerless to do anything except for embarrass the companies and the factories that are, that are continuing these practices. Now in terms of, so literal change, the FEPC is not doing much, as it turns out. But again, since we’re wrestling with–I, I’ve been talking about the tension between the symbolic and the real. At the symbolic level, the FEPC contributes to the, to blacks’ reorientation away from notions of, you know, systems of white patronage. They have to rely on white patrons to make ends meet, but they could turn to the federal government instead, but the federal government, and I started talking about it with the Black Cabinet through Marian Anderson’s concert on Easter Sunday, 1939, the federal government is now standing in, in complicated ways, certainly, but still standing in and keeping an eye on the quality of black life.\nChapter 4. The March on Washington Movement and the Congress on Racial Equality [00:09:32]\nWell, here we are in 1941 and 1942, the U.S. is now involved in the Second World War. And as you’ll remember from going back to the First World War, as, as the U.S. is about to get involved and W. E. B. Du Bois called on African Americans to close ranks, but then called on them to return fighting. You have black soldiers enlisting in terrifically large numbers. You have a lot of the same kind of troubling dynamics about training black soldiers, their treatment abroad, positive by foreign troops and foreign citizens and negative by U.S. troops. And you have the treatment coming home that is scandalous. The Pittsburgh Courier, along with the Chicago Defender, the two most important black newspapers of the day, the Pittsburgh Courier, aware that the same dynamic might repeat itself, that is, you know, black soldiers fighting for citizenship rights and being denied them, in February of 1942 begins a campaign. It’s–It is a publicity campaign; it’s nothing beyond that, but it becomes very popular. It’s the Double V campaign, Double V, two Vs: that there would be victory over fascism abroad and victory over racial discrimination at home. This is just like Du Bois’s call, “We return. We return from fighting. We return fighting.”  Okay?  But twenty-three years have passed. It’s the same call, it’s the same agenda. That’s the important thing to understand.\nNow Randolph bluffs FDR into signing this executive order, and Randolph realizes he has an important opportunity here to make something out of this bluff and this March on Washington Movement becomes an organization, not just one person trying to organize a march, but it actually becomes its own grassroots organization, the MO–MOWM. There’s no easy way to say it. The March on Washington Movement embodies a certain set of tactics and they are, for lack of a better phrase, racial tactics. Randolph, as you already know, was an anti-communist. He was deeply concerned about white communists infiltrating the National Negro Congress and when it happened, he broke from it. And he saw that the March on Washington Movement was a way–by–he kept it all-black. I should have said that first. It was an all-black movement. He saw by keeping it all-black, it would reduce or even eliminate the chance that the Communist Party would infiltrate the organization, since the Communist Party was predominantly white. But Randolph was very clear, since we’re in a time of war, to go to great ends to make sure his movement was not considered black nationalist. Although it’s all-black, it’s not black nationalist. And Randolph declares, and I’m quoting here:\n“We condemn all dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi and Communists. We are loyal, patriotic Americans all. But if American democracy will not defend its defenders; if American democracy will not protect its protectors; if American democracy will not give job to its–jobs to its toilers because of race or color; if American democracy will not issue–insure equality of opportunity, freedom and justice to its citizens, black and white, it is a hollow mockery and belies the principles for which it is supposed to stand.”\nThe March on Washington Movement is all-black. It certainly welcomes white support, but not within the organization itself, and it is profoundly patriotic as far as its assertions–as far as its assertions are concerned. On the ground, the March on Washington Movement engaged in mass, nonviolent, direct action, a blend of Gandhi’s tactics and Randolph’s experiences with labor sit-down strikes. He believed in small direct actions, you know, going into one region or, you know, a part of the country with small and highly symbolic acts of resistance. You know it has, It’s sort of a hodgepodge of org–of, of, of , of groups operating under its banner, doing different things in different places, but all embracing an all-black agenda, an all-black constituency, mass nonviolent, direct action.\nThere’s another group that’s founded in 1942, a year after the March on Washington Movement, that embraced this secular–that embraced a different agenda from the March on Washington–a different organizing agenda, pardon me, from the March on Washington Movement. It was interracial civil rights organization called the Congress on Racial Equality, CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, an off-shoot of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. CORE was founded in 1942. Its director was James Farmer, and one of the principal organizers was a man, was a man named Bayard Rustin, someone we’ll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. CORE and the March on Washington Movement were two of the main groups operating in, in the 1940s to educate blacks to use nonviolent direct action. So they shared that strategic logic.\nCORE was interracial; March on Washington Movement was all-black. The March on Washington Movement built its base on the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids Union, using Randolph’s organizing skills, and really try to reach out to lower-class blacks as well. CORE was significantly smaller than March on Washington Movement, and it was focused on essentially the demographic you represent: college aged student, highly educated, interracial, and essentially elitist. CORE’s mission statement says that it has one purpose: to eliminate racial discrimination, and it has one method: interracial nonviolent, direct action. And of course, style was to test, to negotiate, to confer and then to sit-in. Test, negotiate, confer, and sit-in.\nNow I’m going to move away from these two groups rather quickly, but I wanted you to understand these different organizing logics, although they’re sharing the same strategic mode of engagement. Understand they’re happening in the 1940s as well, because as I hope to make clear through this lecture and through much of the next couple of weeks’ lectures, it’s very critical you start to re-periodize the Civil Rights Movement. The kinds of things that I just mentioned here, I hope that you will recognize from your basic high school American History class, talking about the Civil Rights Movement, that famous movement between fifty-four and sixty-eight, at the most, okay?  The strategies of, of, of, sort of the high theater of the Civil Rights Movement roots go back to the 1940s and beyond, with direct corrections and a, a direct lineage of, of sorts, of resistance. You need to understand this; it’s rather important.\nChapter 5. Politics in the 1940s: A Period of Transition and War [00:17:13]\nNow what’s happening in the 1940s?  What’s the scene in which the March on Washington Movement and CORE are operating?  The country is in transition. It’s in war. As I already mentioned, the Great Migration happening in the first two decades of the twentieth century. There’s another migration happening now that dwarfs the Great Migration, a migration of African Americans, many of whom are following defense industry jobs out west and in the North. Essentially, the black population you know of in Los Angeles is there because of, of defense industry jobs and factory jobs during this period of time. This is the moment, over the next decade, when African Americans move from being predominantly a rural population–I think it’s about forty percent at that point–to over fifty or fifty-five percent urban. So it’s a transition, profound transition, for African Americans, as far as demographics are concerned.\nNow with this migration, like the first Great Migration, you have crisis, pressure for housing, cultural styles, political battlefields. Nineteen forty-three is a spectacular year for crisis. You have race riots happening in the summer of forty-three in forty-seven different cities. One of the most famous is the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles, which involved not blacks in this case, but Mexicans, and Mexican Americans, and white navy–I think it’s navy. I’m pretty sure it’s navy–members of the navy attacking Los Angelinos who happened to be Mexican, for straying across racial and social lines. The worst riot happens in Detroit, a mere ten days before a March on Washington Movement convention in Chicago. The riot, in all of its violence, colored the March on Washington Movement in Chicago–convention in Chicago, and so militant race leadership is seen as too provocative and un-American. And really, people can deny the fact that blacks actually were beginning to get jobs in these factories, because factories were so desperate for workers.\nYou have migration, racial violence, a country at war, the March on Washington Movement agitating, making some headway as far as its long-term goals, but also having a narrower range in which it could operate, because, you know, appearing un-American is the last thing you want to do at this moment in time. It’s something that Randolph himself articulates. Meanwhile, membership in the NAACP skyrockets, as the organiza–organization appears to be a more moderate and reasonable location for civil rights agitation than the all-black March on Washington Movement, even though it’s making, it’s a pro-American stance, and more moderate than this upstart CORE that people don’t really know what to make of yet. So you have now, by the mid-1940s, the NAACP becoming, turning into this moderate organization, by outward appearances, where it was on the edge, sort of the avant garde, when it was founded, and for the first decade, decade, two decades of its existence. Things are shifting.\nThings shift fundamentally in 1944 in a legal case, Smith v. Allwright, that outlaws the white, outlaws the white-only primary. And I have to apologize. I have to go really quickly through a lot of these things, because I lost a lecture by the midterm, so I’m not going to get into the details. But in the Smith v. Allwright case, the white, white primaries, white primaries are now outlawed, and now liberal groups, broadly defined, start going after a whole set of different means of exclusion, of preserving, essentially an all-white vote. Groups start going after literacy tests that were, that were at the point of absurdity, where a registrar could actually ask somebody, “How many bubbles are there in a bar of soap?” as a way to exclude them. People knew they had to act in terms of trying to expand the right to vote, or access to the ballot box, ballot box, by just looking at Mississippi.\nIn Mississippi, you have over three hundred and fifty thousand blacks who are eligible to register, register to vote. Mississippi has a huge black population. And of that three hundred and fifty thousand, only twenty-five hundred manage to vote in 1946. It’s an all-white vote, because of all the various ways in which Mississippi registrars and voters are being told to eliminate the black vote. In fact, very famously, Senator Bilbo from, from Mississippi, who was a virulent racist, would go around organizing registrars of voters of–before actual election night, telling them all these different ways in which you can eliminate the black vote, and said, you know, “If worst comes to worst, you all know the most effective strategy is the night before the election, and you know what I mean,” I mean essentially calling for them to rally the Klan to eliminate black vote. Again, the country’s in–under incredible stress because of these transitions going on.\nBetween forty-six and forty-eight at the presidential level, some more radical changes are happening. FDR had died in office already. Now Harry Truman is the President, and he’s fighting for his political life. The Democratic Party’s on the verge of being split. Recognizing that there’s incredible dissension amongst the Democratic ranks, Southern Democrats are very unhappy with the trends in what’s happening in the country, supported by the federal government, that entity that blacks saw as a place of salvation. Truman doesn’t know what to do, and so he actually lets–he sort of throws a bone to his antagonists in the Democratic Party and lets Congress kill the FEPC. So now there’s no more publicity campaign machine to sort of embarrass factories into employing African Americans and practicing non-discrimination policies. Truman lets Congress kill the FEPC but knows he needs the black vote to win election. It was clear when FDR got elected in 1944, it was clear that the black vote is what brought him, got him into office, and Truman can’t lose it.\nSo Truman raises the stakes, after killing the FEPC, and appoints a distinguished panel to serve as the President’s Commission on Civil Rights, which would recommend over time more adequate means and procedures for the protection of civil rights for U.S. citizens. In October Forty-Seven, it issues its, its report, called “To Secure These Rights,” a landmark document. “To Secure These Rights” defined the nation’s civil rights agenda for the next generation. The commission noted the many restrictions on blacks and urged that each person, regardless of race, color, or national origin, should have access to equal opportunity in securing education, decent housing, and jobs. Among its proposals, the commission suggested anti-lynching and anti-poll tax laws, a permanent FEPC, and strengthen–strengthening the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The commission went much further than Southern Democrats ever imagined they would dare to go, further than Truman thought they would actually go. But he called this commission together and so he had to face a choice, what to do.\nSo in February of 1948, Truman rolls the dice and calls for the implementation of the Commission’s recommendations. Southerners immediately threaten a filibuster and Truman, unable to secure support from Congress or action from Congress, moves ahead using executive authority. And among other things, he bolsters the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, appoints the first black judge to the federal bench, names several other blacks to high ranking administrative positions, and most important, on July 26th of 1948, he issued the executive order abolishing segregation in the armed forces and ordered full integration of all the services. The executive orders that grow out of this array of changes are 9980, nine-nine-eight-zero, establishing fair employment practices in the federal government, and the next one immediately, so you can see he’s going on a tear, Executive Order 9981 establishes the President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces, the decree that leads to the desegregation order to the military. Now it’s the order. The military takes its sweet old time desegregating, but the order’s issued in 1948, growing out of this–Truman’s political move to sort of clarify the mess of the Democratic Party, make it known to African Americans that he was going to support them, the Democratic Party would support them.\nBut was it enough?  Henry Wallace, who had been a former Vice President of FDR, before he got booted, very progressive and challenges Truman from the left. The real challenge comes from the right, within the Democratic Party, let me be clear. Truman’s support for a strong civil rights platform for the Democratic, Democratic convention that was coming up is opposed by conservative Democrats. And they say, “If you bring this platform to the convention floor, we will leave.”  Truman brought the platform to the convention floor and conservative Democrats from Southern states bolt and form what is popularly known as the Dixiecrat Party, with Strom Thurmond as its presidential candidate. The Democratic Party is split and it’s quite unclear what’s going to happen. Now, what happens is that Truman wins by a hair’s breath, and again, without black support, he never would have been elected to a full term as President.\nChapter 6. Legal Transformations in the 1940s: Brown v. Board of Education [00:28:29]\nNow that’s what’s happening on sort of the high political stage throughout the 1940s. Let me quickly canvass what’s happening, it’s still politics of course, but in the legal arena, over this period, to help you understand another element of this, of this shift that’s happening in the country on these issues. And what I want to give you is the legal history of Brown v. Board of Education. That’s where this is heading up to. The legal history begins at Howard University Law School. I already mentioned before the National–the New Negro Alliance, excuse me, formed in 1933, relied upon law school students and law professors at Howard University Law School to argue its case that eventually becomes a Supreme Court decision in 1930–I forgot my notes. I’ll just guess thirty-seven, I’m blanking right now. But the battle begins at Howard University Law School. Excuse me, I’ve lost track for a second. There we go.\nCharles Houston, the attorney who also spearheads its citizens campaign for Marian Anderson’s concert, he’s brought in to head up the law school in the late-1920s, to bring it up to fully accredited status. He starts hiring professors of law. Some of the great legal jurists of the next twenty and thirty years, forty years would actually start at Howard University Law School as professors, and they would train that first cadre of civil rights attorneys. In fact, the first civil rights law class in the country was taught at Howard during this period. The most famous student during the period, this, this early-1930s, is Thurgood Marshall. Thurgood Marshall, a native of Maryland, wanted to go to the University of Maryland School of Law, but by practice, blacks were not admitted, so he had to go to–he ended up going to Howard University. And at that very small law school with some very intense faculty, he goes through sort of a boot camp for several years, and comes out with the kind of legalized training, with special attention to civil rights cases.\nMarshall scores his first major court victory along these lines in 1935, in a case called Murray versus Pearson. In this case, a guy named Donald Murray was not allowed to enter the University of Maryland because he was black. Raymond Pearson, the president of the University of Maryland–so it’s the student versus the president as far as naming conventions, Murray versus Pearson–said that Murray could obtain separate but equal training at the Princess Anne Academy, also in the state of Maryland. However, the Princess Anne Academy did not offer a legal degree, which is what Murray was actually trying to obtain. Making a long story short, Marshall and his mentor, now increasingly colleague, Charles Houston, who’s now the head of the Legal Defense Fund at NAACP, argue the case up to the Supreme Court. And the court declares that the University of Maryland, because it did not have a separate and equal facility for teaching law, had to let Murray in. Okay, that’s 1935.\nBased on the success of that case, Houston brings Marshall over to the NAACP and they start traveling from southern courthouse to a southern courthouse to southern courthouse, filing law–lawsuits for black students and teachers. In 1938, in the case–these are Supreme Court cases by the way–Gaines v. Canada. Lloyd Gaines is the plaintiff and Canada—who is, I’m missing the first name here, It’s the last name of the registrar of the University of Missouri. So the case is called Gaines v. Canada. It’s a student versus the registrar of the University of Missouri. The University of Missouri refused to admit Lloyd Gaines, African American, to its law school because the school was only for whites. It was common in Missouri for the state to send black students to neighboring states for courses of study not offered by Missouri’s black schools. Since Missouri did not have a separate but equal law school for blacks, the Supreme Court declares that Gaines had to be allowed to attend the University of Missouri Law School.\nSo you have in Murray v. Pearson, there’s no separate institution offering a law degree in Maryland, so you have to let, admit Murray into the school of law. In Gaines v. Canada, University of Missouri, the idea of shipping a student out of state–which was not just a Missouri practice by the way. A lot of southern students–states did this–was ruled unconstitutional. The state had to provide state-funded separate but equal legal facility. Now, I mean, one might ask, why’s, why would a state even, you know, provide these fellowships, scholarships to get the students educated in law school if not in their own state?  The thinking was, you got them out of the state, they would stay out of the state. So the south was trying to export black legal, potential legal talent to northern places mainly. To get that “problem” out of their state, they’d pay for them to leave. The Supreme Court says, “Can’t do it.”  That’s 1938, if I didn’t mention that.\nHouston and Marshall keep plugging away, filing the lawsuits, poking at the system. In 1946, they take on the case of a woman named Ada Sipuel. In forty-six, Sipuel had applied to the University of Oklahoma Law School and was denied because of race. And in 1948, the Supreme Court finally rules that Oklahoma had to provide instruction for blacks equal to that of whites. So this is now–not following—they’re not breaking new ground here. They’re following a precedent that was there in the Donald v. Murray, bounded by Gaines v. Canada, say you can’t ship her out some place else. So Oklahoma says, “All right, well we’re going to comply. We’re not going to admit her to our law school, to the white law school. We’ll build a law school for her.”  And so in a few months’ time the state of Oklahoma creates the Langston University School of Law, located at the state capital, thus requiring further litigation to demonstrate that the law school was inferior to the University of Oklahoma’s law school.\nI mean, the lawyers were, were claiming, “You cannot build a law school in a few months,” and it really was just done in a few months, “designed to educate blacks in the state and suggest that it’s even near equal to what the University of Oklahoma’s already established law school provides.”  They don’t have the resources, they don’t have the access, they don’t have the training available to them. So further litigation ensues and in 1949, Oklahoma, the University of Oklahoma decides to admit Sipuel, thus breaking the color line for the School of Law there. Sipuel becomes not just the first black woman, or black, to integrate in the University of Oklahom–Oklahoma Law School, she’s the first black woman to attend an all-white law school in the entire South. The law school admits here and gives her a special chair. That’s nice, it seems, right?  Well, the chair is marked “colored” and it’s roped off from the rest of the class. She’s in the same classroom but in a roped off section of one.\nNow as it happens, her classmates and teachers actually welcome her into the classroom. The resistance is coming from someplace else, institutionally or governmentally. Stories abound, and Sipuel is—would, would support this, that students shared their notes with her, studied with her, helped her catch up on material if she happened to miss some of it. Sipuel had to eat in a separate section of the, of a separate and chained off and guarded section in the law school cafeteria, and white students would crawl under the chain and eat with her when the guards weren’t around. Her law student tuition are supported by hundreds of small donations and, she would recount later, she believed she owed it to all those who supported her that she had to ser—that she had to make it. Now actually, if you look up on the website, and I imagine one or two might do it right now, even though I hope you don’t, the University of Oklahom–Oklahoma Law School is named for Ada Sipuel now. This is also a generational change of another kind of order.\nIn any event, the important thing about all these different cases, these three sort of landmark cases, they shared some things in common. They’re all about law schools. They’re all about law schools. Marshall and Houston believed that they had to find test cases that would create the greatest chance of sympathy from judges and eventually Supreme Court justices. And so they thought by bringing to their attention, to the judges’ attention, people who wanted to be like them, study the law, and people who–and this is important, and I’ll speak more about it on Monday–who were astonishingly good students. They had to be perfect students. By bringing incredible students in front of them who are trying to become lawyers, these judges might be, you know, have thought, “Well, gosh, this really is a silly system. We need to find some other way, other way around it.”  So that’s one part about it. It’s just about, it’s just about access to law schools.\nNow what it’s also, and probably even more important–not even probably–definitely more important about these law school, these cases, these legal cases, is that none of them challenged Plessy v. Ferguson. All of them are articulated upon the grounds of, there is no separate but equal, equal institution for these black plaintiffs to attend. In Maryland, in Missouri, in Oklahoma, in each of those cases, they’re saying there’s no separate but equal institution. Oklahoma tried making one. It wasn’t equal enough. It was separate but not equal. So these–this is a nice and slow and gentle, I mean according to them, approach to try to break down segregation in higher education. Based on the success they’re meeting with the law schools, they start going after graduate schools.\nSo professional schools into graduate schools, and then they start–I mean, and basically the writing is now on the wall. People see this. They realize the trajectory of these attorneys is heading sort of downward in a sense, hierarchically, and the next battle field is going to be secondary and primary schools. Southern states recognize this and feverishly start trying to improve black schools, which were horrible. I mean the, the statistics are kind of shocking about how poorly funded these schools were, you know, only used textbooks, no transportation. Southern states try–start trying pouring, pouring money into these schools, trying to improve them, so they could actually survive a test of separate but equal. But they’re so bad, they can’t catch up.\nSo the attorneys, NAACP attorneys, start focusing now on elementary and secondary schools and challenging the very principle of segregation in education—that seg–that segregation on racial lines was unconstitutional. They, as they’re going around setting up these test cases, there are five cases all happening at the same time that rise to the Supreme Court’s attention, and the Supreme–Supreme Court bundles them together. There are cases in South Carolina, Virginia, Kansas, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. They bundle them together under Brown, the father of two girls integrating–trying to integrate schools in Topeka, Kansas. But that’s–this is one case representing many other cases. The attorney general of the United States actually calls for the end of segregation, but the reasoning is revealing. He wrote that,\n“Racial discrimination furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills and it raises doubt even among friendly nations as to the intensity of our devotion to the Democratic faith.”\nHe’s not talking about, “Hey, we need to educate our citizens.”  It’s like, “This looks bad on the international scene. It’s embarrassing and it’s, it’s affecting negatively our potential to make change around the world.”  Cutting to the chase, Brown versus the Board of Education makes it to the Supreme Court, and the ruling is offered in May of 1954. Earl Warren, the very new Chief Justice, writes the opinion for a unanimous court that says,\n“The separate educational facilities is in–inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought up (brought, I mean, this is the bundling) are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.”\nSeparation of the races and facilities is inherently unequal, based on equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. Now, very quickly, a few words about Earl Warren himself because it’s actually fascinating. He’s a—while the, while these cases are being bundled and brought up through the, the system, he’s not the Chief Justice. He’s appointed that position–He’s not even on the Supreme Court. He’s appointed to that position after the Chief Justice, Fred Vincent, dies. Someone, jurists, legal, legal historians think it was probably going to go against Brown. Eisenhower, now the President of the United States, appoints what others thought a mere politician to the Supreme Court, thus angering other associate justices who thought they were going to be the next Chief Justice. And Warren would actually go on to become a great mediator on the court, using his political skills. And becomes on– becomes a great civil rights jurist, someone Eisenhower would call “the greatest mistake of his presidency,” appointing Warren to the Supreme Court.\nNow Warren himself did not have a sterling civil liberties record. In fact, it was pretty horrible. When he was the attorney general of California in 1942, he led the move to detain and then inter Japanese Americans. And as he told a conference of his fellow governors in 1943, his first year as governor of California,\n“If the Japs are released, no one will be able to tell the saboteur from any other Jap. We’re now producing approximately half of the ships and airplanes of the country on the Pacific Coast. To cripple these industries or the facilities that serve them would be a bloody–a body blow to the war effort. We don’t want to have a second Pearl Harbor in California. We don’t propose to have the Japs back in California during this war if there is any lawful means of preventing it.”\nThis is one of the great civil rights justices speaking before he was elevated to that position. So people doing some basic psychoanalysis, armchair psychoanalysis, saying Warren is trying–I mean is horrified in retrospect over what he did in a moment of war, what he felt was right at the time, to deny citizenship rights to so many people, and was trying to sort of cleanse himself. Now there’s much more to be said about Brown v. Board of Education, the legal court case. But this part is important to know, in the sense that Warren comes in out of the blue. It probably changes the future of the decision. The, the–If you look at justices’ opinions leading up to Brown, it seemed at best there might be a split in the court, if not a denial, but Warren said, “No, we are going to be active, essentially, and it must be unanimous,” and he basically browbeat the associate justices to line up behind him to offer this ruling. A watershed moment, thus closing the door on the constitutionality of separate but equal, articulated in Plessy v. Ferguson at the end of the nineteenth century.\nNow the Supreme Court says that this is unconstitutional, segregation in, in, in education, but how are you going to change it?  This is probably one of the most–This may be the most cruel but important part of Brown v. Board of Education, is that it’s remanded back to local districts to figure out the best play–best way to desegregate the schools. South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi governors threaten to abolish public schools as a result. “We’ll just close all the damn public schools,” because the Supreme Court is only talking about public places of accommodation. A year after Brown is articulated, it comes back with what people call Brown II, when the Supreme Court sends these cases back to the local, local–sends the cases back to the courts of origins and in deference to local customs, and familiarity, says that these things should proceed with all deliberate speed. One of these wonderfully vague, damningly vague, Supreme Court edicts. All deliberate speed.\nMany people thought, “like really quickly!”  Other people thought, “Let’s deliberate for a long time.”  Speed, after all, is really quite relative. There are many other immediate ramifications or responses to Brown v. Board and its ruling in 1954 and fifty-five. You–We began the lecture with one of them, with Anna, excuse me, Melba Beals as a young girl about to be raped, because the Supreme Court had enraged this white father, that it was going to change the way the world looked for him. We’ll talk more about other ways of resistance and high political theater and Gothic violence in the wake of Brown v. Board when we pick up on Monday. Thank you.\n')

Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Rosa Parks [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  A piece of course business. Just a reminder that the 4 Little Girls, Spike Lee’s documentary about the, the, the, the murder of four girls in Birmingham, is going to be screened tonight at eight o’clock in WLH–\nStudent:  One-nineteen.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Thank you, one-nineteen. Tonight and tomorrow night. It is quite a powerful documentary until about the last five or six minutes, and then the wheels fall off, but that’s like Spike Lee’s films in general. The—But, in any event, you’ll, you’ll know what I’m talking about when it actually happens. The documentary itself is rather stunning. Now, okay, today’s lecture, if you look at the online guide, is supposed to be about Martin Luther King, the establishment of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. And I’m going to do my absolute best to get us to that moment. We should be able to do it. But because of the lost lecture due to the midterm, this is sort of my last attempt to get us back on schedule. So I want to canvass a slightly larger period.\nToday I plan on discussing some critical aspects of the Montgomery bus boycott and the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, events from fifty-four, excuse me, fifty-five, fifty-five, fifty-seven. By doing so, it allows me to talk about a very important aspect of the movement that I’ve made an allusion to already once or twice in the course, but you’ll certainly see it coming up again–time and again over the next few weeks of the course, and that is the issue of respectability. Just as we can look at the late nineteenth century’s–century and issues of, of being civilized, of having proper sort of normed middle class behaviors is very important to at least the black leadership elite class, being respectable, being the right kind of person is fundamental to understanding a lot of the civil rights struggles. Now let’s look at the Montgomery bus boycott. And I’m going to presume that in the history of the Montgomery bus boycott and the desegregation of Central High School, this is now American History 101 that you should have had the gloss of it when you were in high school. And I’m sure you didn’t get much more than the gloss, and I’m sure the gloss was wrong. [students laugh]  But what I want to do is actually give you–you know the mythic narrative of these things, which is there for a reason, and I want to give you some background details that are important to consider.\nSo as far as the boycott is concerned, Montgomery bus boycott, there’s a standard history that has become mythic. Rose Parks, the tired seamstress, refuses to give up the seat, her seat, on the bus in Montgomery and she gets arrested. Martin Luther King comes swooping in to her rescue and then rises to the national scene with his leadership of the yearlong boycott, thirteen-month boycott, that would, that would ensue shortly thereafter. I was looking at the syllabus last night and realized I dropped a reading for you. And I want to encourage you to go back and look at it now. I’m referencing it right now. I believe it’s pages three fifty-two to three sixty-one in the Manning Marable anthology. It just, I just, it just slipped out of the syllabus by accident. And in those pages, you’ll see Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, a prominent black woman in Montgomery, explain her version of the events around the bus boycott. Just even knowing about Jo Ann Gibson Robinson changes the story of the bus boycott. Robinson was part of a cadre of, of middle-class African American women, sort of think of the club women from the early, late-nineteenth century that I talked about a few weeks ago, who had already organized into a force, the Women’s Political Council. These were women who were well-educated, college educated, some of them teaching at a local college. These were sort of the elite. Although they didn’t ness–they weren’t rolling in money, these were the elite in, in black Montgomery.\nThe Women’s Political Council with Jo Ann Gibson Robinson’s leadership, she’s one of the key figures in it, has already gone to the black ministers in town and the city government in town about their frustration over the way that blacks were treated on the buses and the way they were treated in stores downtown. “Economic boycott” are the words they’re floating around. They wanted to try to develop the courage in the black community to get a boycott organized. The Women’s Political Council keeps running into dead ends in various places. They might get a meeting, but the meeting, frankly, where men were in a leadership position, would be rather condescending to the women: “That’s very sweet of you to come in, but , you know, we’ll take care of things now.”  Nothing would happen.\nNow the Women’s Political Council actually tries to organize boycotts of the buses around issues of crisis, and this is when other people get arrested for refusing to give up their seat. Now if you look at the selection in the Marable reading and Jo Ann Gibson Robinson’s recounting of the bus boycott and Rosa Parks arrest, you might find something striking. When I was actually going back and looking at it tonight, like, “God, how did I forget to include this?”  If you scan it, as I did several times, for Martin Luther King’s role, you will only see King’s name mentioned once and, quite literally, in the second to last line, I believe, of this reading. Now this is an excerpt, granted. Things might have been dropped out. But if nothing else, metaphorically, it’s actually a very important point. King was not there, not engaged in the organizing moment, early organizing moments of the bus boycott, what would turn into the bus boycott.\nNow why bother telling this story?  Just because it’s inserting a new cast of characters?  Well, maybe that’s part of it. Maybe because it was pointing to the role that women played in the movement, had always played in the movement. That’s certainly part of it as well. But another part of it’s important to know, is that the bus boycott was, its success was incumbent upon many different factors. It wasn’t just King’s charisma, although we cannot ever discount King’s charisma. Part of it was dealing with an already established and organized, politically organized, black middle-class, as basically the organizing is done through their women. There’s already then a network of activists in place, upon which King’s charisma could be displayed, or through which. I don’t know what the right descriptor is. It basically starts to muddy up the narrative of the Civil Rights Movement, this, this amazing moment of the movement. But there’s more to the story, always, more complicating factors.\nRosa Parks was arrested, there’s not doubt about that, but it wasn’t as spontaneous as history makes it out to be. Now Parks is refer–referred to as the mother of the movement, partly because of her indisputable character. She was as proper as one could imagine. She was hardworking, she was civil, she was law-abiding. She’s the perfect person to become a “victim,” of it were, of an insane system. If you can’t treat this person properly, there’s something fundamentally wrong with your system. We know that about Rosa Parks. But what we don’t know is that she’d been trained at a civil rights institute the summer before she decides to get arrested, the Highlander School in Tennessee. Parks was reluctant to go, but she had friends who were already committed to the movement in very public ways, convinced her to come along. And while there, she’s meeting with white radicals, labor activists, Communist Party members, other black activists from around the country, and learning about nonviolent civil disobedience, learning about different strategies in which to create a crisis for the sake of the greater good. So Rosa Parks, now she’s not a fire breathing radical. She’s not at the vanguard, but she is trained and she’s prepared for that moment when it actually happens. That’s dropped out of the history.\nAnother thing that’s dropped out of the history is, she was not the first woman–or person, but in this case, woman– to be arrested for, you know, violating etiquette on the buses, certainly not in Montgomery, certainly not in other places. In fact, a few weeks before Parks was arrested, a young woman named Claudette Colvin was arrested in a similar situation. The boycott almost emerged, organized by the Women’s Political Council, and the boycott almost emerged revolving around Colvin’s arrest. She was a straight A student; she seemed to be of impeccable character. If you’re treating a child like this, how could you treat any–I mean how could you claim to be humane?  It turns out though, that very quickly discovered that they couldn’t use her, Colvin, as a vehicle for their boycott, because this straight A student of unimpeachable character, unmarried of course, also happened to be pregnant. She was not showing at the moment. People in Montgomery, black activists, realized right away there’s no case. That they, they cannot make a case around her because of Southern traditions that would say that she was immoral for her, quote, “condition.”  And that would have been the word that would have been used. And they knew that they could not make a convincing case if they have someone with such failed standards, such immorality in her system, that she’d be the worst example for these women activists. The activists understood that being respectable in a very narrow band of what that means was absolutely critical.\nRespectability is so important to the movement, because anything that transgressed a line of being respectable could be used to justify a denial of some sort, whether it’s legal, “You can’t come to this school,” whether it’s psychological, “I can, I can limit your entire existence in terms of possibilities,” or whether it’s physical, “I can kill you.”  Let’s just go back to Brown v. Board and the reactions to it. I already told you about Melba Beals’ experience as she’s about to be raped when she’s twelve years old, but we can see in reactions in other places in the South, systemic reactions, the extent or the ways in which there was a logic that blacks had to behave just right because the stakes were so high. In the wake of Brown v. Board, in July of Fifty-Four, the White Citizens Council is formed. I’m simplifying a lot, but think of it as the upper crust Ku Klux Klan. Business leaders, white males, prominent figures in these Southern towns that organized, Southern cities, organized themselves, fund Klan activities, making sure in a variety of ways that there would not be an integration or destruction of their social order.\nChapter 2. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Emmett Till [00:10:57]\nEconomic warfare happens across the South with, with city leaders, white coun–white citizens councils battling it out with radicals, the most proper radicals, like Jo–Jo Ann Gibson Robinson. Governments start responding. This arcane little caveat in, in–excuse me, loss of words here–in how governments interact, the doctrine of interposition. It’s a weird phrase. The doctrine of interposition is invoked by Southerners, saying that the federal government had no power to interfere in states. This goes back to 1832 or something like that. Completely ignored little tidbit attached on some bill somewhere. Southern governors and governments start invoking the doctrine of interposition, saying the federal government had no power to interfere, interfere in states. Federal officials from the South, members of the House of Representatives and Senate, gather together and all through the Southern manifesto, saying that Brown was a clear abuse of judicial power. Only one member from a federal delegation in the South refused to participate, and that’s Al Gore, Sr. from Tennessee. Wait, I might be blanking on that. I think–\nStudent:  Kefauver\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway: Kefauver, yeah, thank you.\nStudent: and Linden Johnson.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Was it three?\nStudent:  It was three.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Well, there you go, it was three. Well done. Where’d you learn this history?   Did you take this class last year?\nStudent:  No, I just wrote a paper on postwar America.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Excellent. Well done. You were trained by somebody well. Anyway, but thank you. There was–All but three of I think maybe a hundred people.\nStudent:  No, there were representatives who didn’t do it, including Rayburn\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Oh, well hell, apparently I don’t know the history at all.\nStudent:  There were other representatives.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  This is why it’s so dangerous to talk to students at Yale. The fact is massive–the Southern Manifesto is a declaration that Brown doesn’t carry weight. There’s going to be a negative response of, of, of resistance, and the phrase becomes known as massive resistance; that the South is going to refuse to proceed forward with the logic coming down from the Supreme Court. People start becoming targeted. NAACP as an organization becomes targeted by Southern legislatures, saying the NAACP had to reveal its membership list in order to stay in business as a, as a, an organization, had to reveal who was in its membership. This is basically a death warrant to the organization in some states, and to people who were, and to people who were members. If you were known to be a member of the NAACP and worked in Mississippi, well, you know, the boss might decide you don’t have your job any longer, for some other trumped up reason. And it might actually get you killed. Violence takes on gothic proportions in Mississippi more than any other place. In fifty-five, several black leaders urging blacks to vote were murdered, one on the local courthouse lawn. The president of a local NAACP chapter was shot down when he ignored the order to remove his name from the voting register.\nAnd then of course there was Emmett Till, fourteen year old, fourteen-year old boy, sent from Chicago to stay with his family in Mississippi. There are many different versions of what happens. The allegation is that he whistled one day, hanging out with his cousins, that he whistled at the–a white storekeeper’s wife when she walked past. Others have countered saying he had a, he had a stutter, and, you know, he would often lisp as a result. What actually happened at that moment is really inconsequential. What happens later is of great consequence. That night he’s abducted. He’s beaten. One of his eyes is gouged out. He’s wrapped in barbed wire and tied to farm equipment before being thrown over a bridge. When they find him, his body is sent surreptitiously up to Chicago. His mother insists on having an open casket at the Chicago funeral and the images shock the country. There’s a clip here, that opens up with Mose Wright, who was Emmett Till’s uncle, who makes a very famous declaration going into court. And he points out the people who came to get Emmett Till from him, which meant he could no longer live in Mississippi. He vacated right away in order that he might live to see another day.\n[Mose Wright:] When the sheriff came and told me they had found a body at Pillow… [indecipherable] and wanted me to go and identify the body, which I did. And we found the body, which it didn’t have on any clothes at all. The body was so badly damaged that we couldn’t hardly just tell who he was, but he happened to have on a ring with his initials, and that cleared it up.\n[Narrator:] The body was shipped home, back north to Chicago where Mamie Till Bradley insisted on an open casket funeral, “So all the world can see,” she said, “what they did to my boy.”\n[singing]\n[Narrator:] Jet magazine showed Till’s corpse, beaten, mutilated, shot through the head. A generation of black people would remember the horror of that photo.\n[Mamie Till Bradley:] I believe that the whole United States is mourning with me, and that the death of my son can mean something to the other unfortunate people all over the world. Then for him to have died a hero would mean more to me than for him just to have died.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  When you heard the narrator, Julian Bond, talking about a generation would never forget this murder and the image that appeared in Jet magazine, he wasn’t exaggerating. One of my former colleagues, her father’s family from, was from Louisiana, from a rural part of Louisiana, and I was–he was visiting. We were having lunch together, dinner together, and Emmett Till came up. I can’t remember why. But he said he was fourteen or fifteen years old when Emmett Till was murdered, and he knew then that he had to leave the South as soon as he could, and in fact, he never went back. And he said he has never forgotten, and he knew there was no hope for, as he put it, “a black man in the deep South.”  Now there was a court case. It was an all-white, all male jury. The jury deliberates for sixty-seven minutes. One juror said later, it wouldn’t have taken so long if they hadn’t stopped to get a soda. And the jury defines–finds the defendants not guilty, although everybody knew who did it.\nJanuary Fifty-Six, one month after Parks’ arrest in Montgomery, Look magazine publishes an interview of the Till defendants in which they state for the record that they had in fact killed him. Now this is the most spectacular and perhaps egregious case of violence gone unpunished, but there were other episodes, and some of them happened as a direct result of Brown. I already again related to you, the attempted rape of Melba Beals, but violence is endemic. In fact, this is one of the great stories of the nonviolent civil rights movement, is that it was horribly violent and it’s rather shocking that it did not become more violent at any given moment.\nChapter 3. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: The Little Rock Nine [00:20:09]\nNow thinking of violence and respectability and narratives of the Civil Rights Movement leads us to the Little Rock Nine. And I have to gloss over the history very quickly for the sake of time. Melba Beals goes on–the person who was twelve years old when someone loses his mind and tries to attack her–goes on to come–become one of nine teenagers who are eventually selected by NAACP activists to integrate Little Rock Central High School.\nThey are focusing on Arkansas because it seemed to be one of the most progressive states in the South on these issues. Other parts–other school systems in Arkansas had actually already integrated, but Central was the most important, most visible high school in the state. The nine who were selected were amazing students, academically gifted, coming from the right families who comported themselves in the right way. Otherwise they would never have been selected. Without going over too much of the famous integration of Central High, I’ll point out a few things that are, that one needs to remember. The students are selected to integrate in fifty-seven. There’s fierce local resistance. The governor, Orval Faubus, calls in the Arkansas National Guard to prevent integration. President Eisenhower, very unhappy about the whole scene, sends in the one hundred and first Airborne to force the issue, and he does it not because he believed in integration, but because he believed in the federal government’s right to assert itself. This is a states’ rights versus federal rights issue for Eisenhower.\nThe troops ushered in the students after they had already tried to integrate the school before, but were harassed by mobs outside of the building. The students—the, the troops could go with the students up to the, the door of the classroom, but in the classroom, or in the bathroom, or in the cafeteria, all hell broke loose. One student had lye thrown in her face, almost permanently blinded. Students would talk like being in the bathroom, and then going to the bathroom, and then paper towels lit on fire being thrown overhead when they were helpless. They were attacked, books were thrown down, food poured on them, but they could not respond. The one student who did respond got kicked out, at which point they said, “One nigger down; eight more to go,” trying to get these students out of the school. Houses were bombed, people were shot–shot at, folks lost their jobs. Now think about all this. What is it that’s being asked of these children? And they are children.\nGoing back to Melba Beals, there’s a few items from her diary entry, New Year’s Day in 1958, that allow us to ask some pretty important questions. Four different items, selected from a longer list is, one, “to behave in a way that pleases Mother and Grandma,” two people who were very central in her life. “To keep faith and understand more of how Gandhi behaved when his life was really hard; to pray daily for the strength not to fight back.”  And the entry that, the resolution that she, that she put as number one, was to “do my best to stay alive until May twenty-nineth,” the end of the school year. I mean, think about it: NAACP activists, grown women and men, are making sure the children stay–are to stay in school, despite the violence being vet–being visited upon them. And it’s very fair to ask, is it appropriate for sixteen year olds to feel the need to write in their diaries that the most important New Year’s resolution is to “do my best to stay alive” until the end of the school year?   What are the adults asking the children to do for the sake of the movement?  It’s a case–it’s a question that would come up quite angrily in 1963 in the Birmingham crisis.\nNow one final note about the school year and Little Rock. What we don’t often hear about, what we basically never hear about Central High School history, is that the govern–I mean, because it’s a triumphant moment, right?  So the governor was so upset about the public relations disaster that accompanied the school’s integration, that he decided to shut down Little Rock public schools the following year. The integration of the school, this great moment of civil rights victory of American exceptionalism, lasted one year, and the public schools were shut down. Why don’t we know this part of the history?  You know, there’s something really maybe too tantalizing about these nice narratives of our past. We can be ashamed of the shortcomings of our predecessors, but by keeping the story clean and simple, we can also be proud that our predecessors ultimately made the right decision and did the right things. In short, the Civil Rights Movement has been sanitized, because it ultimately casts a great light on the American character; that, you know, the American character can take its lumps, learn from its mistakes and then do great things. The Civil Rights Movement has been cast as a great moment of American exceptionalism when we all summoned the courage to do the right things, regardless of our political positions, where we are in the country, etcetera. Well, that’s just one big fat lie. Only a minority of folks rose to the challenge, and accepted it, and pursued it.\nChapter 4. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Martin Luther King, Jr [00:26:09]\nMartin Luther–Martin Luther King’s history is a case in point as far as rising to a challenge, and as far as what happens when a history is sanitized profoundly. King is raised in a tradition of ministers. His father and grandfather run the most elite black church in Atlanta. King has a rather raucous adolescence and college years. He and his buddy go around trying to run competitions about, you know, who could “deflower the most girls” in the language of the day. He does receive a religious–religious calling, however, goes off to seminary and then gets a PhD at Boston University, a PhD which scholars discovered, much to their great disappointment, about two decades ago, that he had plagiarized parts of it. King, though, these things aren’t widely known at this moment in time, fifty-five, is seen as a real future star, and he gets a job in Montgomery, heading the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which is, much in the tradition of his father and grandfather, the most elite, sort of upstanding and politically conservative, quiescent church, in that particular city. He’s relatively newly married. He and his wife Coretta have a newborn. He wants to settle into a nice, quiet pulpit and do nice, quiet work.\nWell, there’s already things shifting around on the ground, with the Women’s Political Council agitating for an economic boycott, trying to find a test case to boycott the buses. And the group of black ministers in town are very important people, and a group called the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. A ton of syllables there. The Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance is feeling pressure from Women’s Political Council to do something. King as a minister is automatically in that group. And then as things start heating up towards what will become Rosa Parks’s moment, King is thrust into the limelight in a way he never wanted. Parks gets arrested. King is sent as an emissary or sacrificial lamb–really more of the latter. The Montgomery Improvement Association is formed. This is going to be the group that’s going to organize the boycotts. King does not want to lead it. The other ministers, who are deeply skeptical this thing will actually work, figure, “King just got here. He’s young; he’ll rebound when this thing blows apart. We’ll put him out front.”  King couldn’t say no. He fought, fought, fought, but he couldn’t say no. He’d already resisted the invitation to head the local NAACP for the sake of his children’s, his child’s safety.\nAnyway, on December fifth, the night before the boycott’s set to begin, King is still resisting the urging of the ministers, and finally relents, and writes out some notes on a piece of paper. Goes to the pulpit with about ten, fifteen minutes to prepare and says, in part, the following. Now the audio is, is not great, and I’ll tell you what he says, but I want you to hear the energy of the moment during the closing moments of his, of his speech.\n[Martin Luther King, Jr.:]  And we are not wrong; we are not wrong in what we are doing. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth. If we are wrong, justice is a lie, love has no meaning. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  [music starts playing] Oops! “If we are wrong,” he says–\n“And, and we are not wrong in what we are doing. We are not wrong. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth is, was mer–merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth. If we are wrong, justice is a lie, love has no meaning. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”\nYou can tell, the audience is going crazy, energized by this young man who’s come out of nowhere. But think about what he’s saying here. He invokes God and Jesus. It’s what, what one would expect of course, but he invokes in the first part of this quote the Supreme Court and the Constitution. He’s evoking law. King is not invoking anything radical, as a matter of fact. He’s invoking the Supreme Court and the Constitution. He’s invoking those very things that made citizens citizens in the United States after all, and perhaps that is the thing that made him so radical. Anyway, the movement takes off and the boycott holds together. It’s a, it’s a remarkable history, although it wasn’t the first boycott, bus boycott. The movement holds together for thirteen months before the Supreme Court forces the integration of the, of the buses. These are the same thirteen months when massive resistance is rising up throughout the South, the same thirteen months when Emmett Till is murdered, and the same thirteen months when the strategy for Little Rock becomes articulated and starts to gain traction. A period of astonishing change.\nNow King rises to prominence. He’s traveling all around the country constantly raising money during the bus boycott. They need resources and money to pay for gasoline and cars that are all shipped down to Montgomery to make this thing work. But he’s not doing it by himself. He’s aided by two people who are rather important. One is Bayard Rustin, who I’ve already mentioned before. Earlier part in his life, member of the Young Communist League, a draft resistor, someone who was arrested on morals charges for being caught in the back seat of a car with another man. He’s gay. Often recognized as one of the great organizing minds of the freedom struggles and labor struggles of the twentieth century, but because of the politics of the day, hampered by his sexuality and, and by his communist past. But Bayard Rustin is in King’s corner, you know, telling him, “Do this, do that. You know, follow this particular path.”  King is also aided by Ella Baker. And by the way, Rustin and Baker are finally getting the attention that they deserve from, from amazing histories that have been written about five or six years ago. Ella Baker, a long time activist who worked for unemployment councils in the Great Depression. Certainly was affiliating with folks who were communist. Older woman who becomes hailed by a younger generation of activists who are just about to become known for being one of the most important leaders in the movement. Baker starts to work with King and advising him as well. I’ll come back to them in a moment.\nAs the boycott nears success, we see violence quite clearly. King’s house is bombed. Other people are being shot at. It’s a bloody mess. But Rustin sees in the success and the violence as a catalytic, catalytic moment of possibility, and that the question becomes not so much, “How great was this moment?” but, “What can we do to capitalize upon it?  What can we do to sustain this organizing energy?  There needs to be an organization.”  And he calls on King to bring together other leaders, and, and essentially religious leaders, to gather together to think of the next steps. And out of that comes the Southern Leadership Conference, is what the plan is at least. The Southern Leadership Conference, bringing together, you know, the great leaders in the South, African American, to become organized to have sustained change. Well, King makes a decision that infuriates Rustin, and they have a very tense relationship in general, Rustin recognizing King’s astonishing gifts as a speaker and King recognizing Rustin’s astonishing gifts as an organizer and political thinker.\nKing never likes the fact that Rustin is gay and talks condescendingly to Rustin about it. Rustin always underestimates, in King’s opinion, the role of religion in this movement. So Rustin calls it the Southern Leadership Conference, and King changes its name under, with sort of fiat, to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. And the SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, becomes one of the most important civil rights organizations for the next, really for the next twenty, thirty years. King’s popularity skyrockets with the success of the bus boycott. He’s increasingly drawn away from the pulpit as he travels about trying to raise consciousness and funds. And by January of 1960, having barely been in the pulpit at Dexter over the previous few years, he leaves. He’s not ministering to that church. The SCLC, what he now heads–[student sneezes and he coughs] excuse me, bless you–the SCLC is now focusing on leadership training and citizenship education.\nNow as the SC–SCLC emerges out of King’s success, wrapped up in his charisma, it creates stress in the, in “the system.”  You see stress often embodied in intergroup squabbling, something you’ll see a lot throughout the 1960s. An established organization like the NAACP is not too thrilled about the SCLC arriving on the scene, because they’re competing for the same people and the same dollars, scant dollars. In fact, Medgar Evers, who’s the head of the Mississippi NAACP, who joins the SCLC, this new group, was told he had to choose. You either pick with SCLC or you pick the NAACP. He stays with the NAACP. Now the NAACP is already under stress. I talked about the fact that its rolls are being opened up by Southern legislatures, but there’s also stress internally through people like Robert Williams, military vet from North Carolina, who becomes fed up with events in his town where he’s the head of the local NAACP chapter, and calls for retaliatory violence. He’s kicked out of the NAACP by the end of the 1950s. So the NAACP is struggling with rising, percolating spots of militancy, people leaving the, leaving, leaving the message behind at the NAACP. And now this new group appears on the scene that might pull away other supporters.\nThe important thing to know I guess from that, I suppose, is that neither the SCLC nor the NAACP had control over the movement. No single organization could claim they were the group that was running the movement. And while King is the most electrifying speaker of this great narrative, he hardly had any control over it. If you look to the events of February first of 1960, you can see the way in which there was a sort of wildcat mentality about many things happening in the movement. On that day, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four men, students of North Carolina A and T, black school, head to downtown Greensboro, not far away. They decide that they’re gonna–sick and tired of the treatment they’re receiving at the Woolworth’s, the local five and dime, let me think, drugstore, convenience store. It’s funny, when I began this course, I mean when I began teaching years ago, Woolworth’s were still around. Ain’t so much still around anymore, but the, but the history still is.\nSo the men go to the lunch counter and insist on being served. They could buy things other places in the store, but they couldn’t be served at the lunch counter. The waitress says, ” I can’t, you know, I can’t help you out.” And they sit there, and they sit, and they sit, and they sit, taking up four seats at the lunch counter. It’s a wildcat sit-in. It’s not the first by any stretch. The March on Washington Movement had been organizing them for decades. Labor movements have been organizing them for decades. But this time it takes off. You have just the right mix of electricity, of anticipation, of possibility and frustration certainly. And you see across the country sit-ins by people your age, all across the South. Sixty cities become sites of sit-ins, and all of these sit-ins, the young men and women are well dressed and impeccably mannered. To do anything else would invite potential death.\nElla Baker, the person who’s essentially running the SCLC–King’s the head of it, but Ella Baker’s running it, ministering it–taps into this energy and organizes a youth conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, in April. She’s expecting sort of a modest turnout. Overwhelming turnout, and overwhelming energy. “We, the college age students of the day, need to do something. We are ready.”  And out of that organization grows the Southern Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, otherwise known as SNCC. I said Southern, I’m sorry. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, otherwise known as SNCC. SNCC would never become the biggest of the great civil rights organizations, but more than any, any other organization, it becomes the barometer of an evolution, of the evolution of 1960s’ ideology. And SNCC will be part of, of the narrative that I lay out over the next two and a half weeks of the course, because through them, you can actually see the changes, and really quite radical changes, in movement ideology during the 1960s.\nBut at its founding moment in April in 1960, SNCC is a group of college age individuals who espoused nonviolent ideology, who are absolutely interracial, and who wanted to be organized through a non-hierarchical system. They are, from the beginning, seen as a temporary organization, literally given a corner space in the offices of the SCLC headquarters. So it was operating under SCLC’s umbrella, SCLC thinking, “This is a great way to get more youth involved in our movement.”  You could even look back to the founding moment and see there’s already some fissures in the relationship, if only because SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, is committed to a non-hierarchical organ–organizing logic. They, like Ella Baker, are a little bit nervous in the fact that SCLC is embodied in King, a magnificent man, but a far from perfect man, but only one man, and they wanted an organization that had many leaders. Now that’s April 1960.\nHeading into the fall, in October, King was arrested in Atlanta for violating, violating probation, on trumped up charges, and he’s sentenced to four–I mean, I think it was a traffic violation. He’s sentenced to four months hard labor. John F. Kennedy, who is campaigning for the presidency, calls Coretta Scott King and says that he will protect King. He actually had no way of protecting King, but in orchestrated phone calls, “I will do everything I can to protect your husband.”  And with that, black support for Kennedy mushrooms. Kennedy goes on to win by a hundred and twenty thousand votes–still debates whether those votes actually existed or not–but he won by a hundred and twenty thousand votes, and it’s clear that it’s African American support, support that swung the election his direction. Blacks have in JFK the kind of leader at a symbolic and cultural level they have not had since FDR started making these gestures towards recognizing blacks’ needs some twenty-five, thirty years earlier.\nIn 1961–I’m skipping a ton of details. I’m trying to get up to a moment of the most famous crisis–in 1961, CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, as I mentioned in the last lecture, organizes a, a new round of freedom rides, getting on buses, integrated riders, and crossing state lines. Members of SNCC are on the bus as well. Students from Yale, from other places in Connecticut, jump on these buses and head on South. Once they cross into the deep South, the buses are attacked by smoke bombs, tires are slashed. As people run out of the buses to get away from the smoke, they’re met by mobs who beat them with their fists, with metal poles. The buses are torched. Other buses are sent down. Eventually, the buses arrive down in Birmingham, Alabama, where Bull Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety, knows they’re coming, knows there’s a mob waiting for them at the bus station, and does not offer police protection, and lets the students, the riders, get beaten senseless for fifteen minutes before letting the police come, before releasing the police. And people said, “Well, why did you do such a thing?”  He goes, “It was Mother’s Day. You can’t take a man away from his mother. You know, they needed to have time spent with their mother. You know, they would get there in time.” \nThere’s a dawning at this moment, with this kind of violence and recalcitrance, of a militancy within SNCC and the beginnings of a move away from respectability. You start seeing different agendas being articulated within different organizations. The movement is going in fits and starts. Federations form and break apart. There’s all kinds of infighting, and things seemed on the verge of collapse in Albany, Georgia, when they go to invoke another crisis. And in Albany, Georgia, where you have a confederation of different civil rights organizations coming together, to try to change that town, they’re outsmarted by the white police. As the students try to start filling up the jails to create a crisis of overcrowding and, and get national sympathy, with the jail, no bail strategy “We’ll let ourselves be in jail. We won’t accept bail. They’ll have to force us out. We won’t have paid any bail. This will be great.”  The police chief says, “We’re going to keep our heads and start shuttling people out of jails to other jails.” He doesn’t react, essentially. Nothing happens. Everything fizzles, and there’s a fear that this movement that began, quote, “began,” in quotes, with Brown v. Board and has these violent reactions as you see it with Rosa Parks, and you see it with Emmett Till, and you see it in Central High School, the beginning of a new sort of vibrant youth organization, it feels like it’s all going to collapse in Albany, Georgia, because the white officers realized, “If we don’t react, this thing will go away.”  Well, thank god for Bull Connor. I’ll let the film tell you much of that story, but suffice it to say that Connor did more, through his brutality, to help win converts to the Civil Rights Movement, more than anybody else could have practically done. I’ll pick up on that moment, on that fact, at the next lecture. Thank you.\n')
('african-american-studies', 'AFAM-162', 'lecture_15.txt', 'African American History: From Emancipation to the Present (2010)\nAFAM 162 - Lecture 15 - From Sit-Ins to Civil Rights (continued)\nChapter 1. Introduction [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  The song that, I imagine, for many of you needs no introduction, but for a few of you who may not be familiar with it, that’s one of the great anthems of the Civil Rights Movement, “We Shall Overcome.”  You’re actually lucky, I’m a–in past years I’ve had the TAs get up and sing it with me, I’ve had the class get up and sing it. For some reason, I’m a–I’m, I’m absolving all of us of that kind of performance. I play it here for reasons that will become much more clear later on in the lecture, but this is–this piece of music, “We Shall Overcome,” is one of sort of the anthems of familiarity, of memory, about the movement, and for very good reasons. But as part of my larger project of trying to help us understand a different notion of what the movement was really all about, I want to throw the song out to your senses, leave it dangling there for a while, and come back and sort of reinterpret it as this lecture goes forward, as much as I’m reinterpreting the movement in many ways itself. Let me, with that caveat out there, that introduction, reading Fire Next Time, James Baldwin’s quite important, quite famous book, I thought I would really begin the lecture with a couple of quotes from James Baldwin, from this really fantastic documentary film on James Baldwin called The Price of the Ticket. I’d encourage you all to see it at some point. It’s quite astonishing. Baldwin says during this documentary–he’s, it’s a, it’s archival footage. He’s talking to, it looks like to me, to be something like an Oxford round table, or, or, or here like the Yale Political Union, something to that effect, clearly college-age students. And he declares to these students,\n“…That it comes as quite a shock to discover that the country to which you pledge allegiance does not pledge allegiance to you. It comes as quite a shock to discover that when you are a child rooting for Gary Cooper to shoot all the Indians, that the Indians are you.”\nGary Cooper, for those who don’t know, it’s a different generation, great cinematic hero, often played the good guy, you know cowboys and Indians. And he realizes, James Baldwin, as a little child, as he’s rooting for Gary Cooper to kill all the Indians, he actually is the Indian. Later on in the same documentary, Baldwin talking to a studio audience, being interviewed by one of these talk shows. It’s poetic. He really was poetic. He says,\n“The day will come when you will trust you more than you do now (speaking to presumptively a white audience) and you will trust me more than you do now. We will trust each other. I do believe, I really do believe, in the new Jerusalem. I really do believe that we can all become better than we are. I know we can. But the price is enormous and people are not yet willing to pay it.”\nChapter 2. Martin Luther King: “Letter from Birmingham Jail” [00:03:22]\nMuch of the 1960s is about people coming to terms with the fact of who they are in the American pantheon, the cowboys or the Indians, and also coming to terms with what the price of that ticket is going to be. Now I ended the last lecture talking about the potential failure of the movement in Albany, Georgia, when the white authorities outsmart the activists by not reacting. And then I mentioned, along comes Bull Connor, who as King would say later on, was the most important person for the success of the movement, because of the severity of his actions. Bull Connor’s the Commissioner of Public Safety. I mean, I’ll be skirting along this very quickly, since you watched the documentary, 4 Little Girls, and you know a lot of this, this history and saw some of the images as well. He’s the Commissioner of Public Safety and he’s running for mayor. The election becomes, I’ll just say, fraught with complication. There’s already incredible tensions in, in Birmingham over issues that were similar to Montgomery in terms of who could shop in what stores, and in fact, on the ground in Birmingham, store owners were very willing at this point, because of the threat of economic warfare with the, with the black buying population, very willing to integrate the stores, but Bull Connor says no. And Connor is essentially running, running the city. So things are brought to a head.\nKing, who’s not in Birmingham, is asked to come by the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, who is the head of a civil rights–sort of organizing civil rights activism in Birmingham, through a group called the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. It is essentially the NAACP. I mentioned in the last lecture that NAACP’s books would be opened up by, by state governments, which would be essentially a threat to lose jobs and to, and to be harassed, to even be killed. Other organization–organizations spring up to replace the NAACP. In this case, it’s the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Shuttlesworth calls King to Birmingham, knowing that King more than anybody else has the ability to electrify a population, and frankly to antagonize a population as well. Birmingham had already been the witness or home to all kinds of violence. Between fifty-seven and sixty-three, it had earned its nickname of “Bombingham.”  There were eighteen unsolved bombings in the city in, in black neighborhoods, excuse me. City parks had been closed in 1962. Playgrounds, and pools, and golf courses had gone private. All these actions to prevent the gathering of people, activists, black people, and also to prevent an attempt to force the integration of public spaces. So playgrounds, golf courses, and pools go private. City on edge.\nKing comes to Birmingham and willfully gets arrested. He knows he’s going to get arrested. He’s trying to brew up crisis. But unlike the police in Albany, Georgia, who just, you know, relaxed and let things go and stayed in touch with everybody, Birmingham has not evolved that way in the police force. They throw King into solitary. There’s no word coming from him. This is actually terrifying. This is an era when people would disappear, and King being such a high profile person was not protected from disappearing. Coretta Scott King is frantic, wanting to at least get reassurances that her husband’s alive, not just safe but alive. [coughs] Excuse me. John F. Kennedy is currently the President, been elected, and he gets involved, much like he did when he was the candidate for the presidency, and seeks guarantees of King’s safety and that he’s treated well. While King is in jail, a number of clergy in Birmingham, white clergy, moderates, are basically upset that King is coming in from out of town, out of the blue, and is antagonizing the situation, stirring up trouble, and essentially is telling–publish–they publish a newspaper ad and basically telling King to slow things down, to calm down, to, to lower the temperature.\nKing responds by writing one of the great protest documents and letters, and that’s the Letter from Birmingham Jail. Now the Letter from Birmingham Jail is not in your reader but, you know, it’s online. I hope you’ve actually already looked at it. It’s not in your reader because the King estate is rather protective of King’s legacy and how much people are going to pay to have his words published. I’m being extremely politic in saying this. But the document is one of the most important documents in American protest history. One of the most frequently quoted passages is one I shall now quote as well. It brings together King’s passion, of course, his eloquence, but also humanizes this in a way that connected with many people. This was an, an immediate sensation. King is responding to these, these ministers and says,\n“We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet-like speed toward gaining political independence, but we stiff creep at horse-and-buggy pace–still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging dark–darts of segregation to say, ‘Wait.’ But you–when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: ‘Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?’; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ‘white’ and ‘colored’; when your first name becomes ‘nigger,’ your middle name becomes ‘boy’ however old you are, and your last name becomes ‘John,’ and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ‘Mrs.’; when you are harried by day and hunted–haunted by night by the fact that you are a negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you, when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ‘nobodiness,’ then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of–cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.”\nYears later, James Baldwin, in the same documentary I mentioned, is interviewed by somebody in the early seventies, saying, you know, “You’re so angry, you’re so impatient. These changes you’re talking about take time.”  He shoots back,\n“You say it takes time. It’s taken my father’s time and my mother’s time, my brother’s and sister’s time, my grandfather’s and grandmother’s time, my nephew’s and niece’s time. How much time do you want for your so-called progress?”\nWhat is the pace of change?  It’s going too fast for white moderates. Not going nearly fast enough for African Americans and white activists. So King writes the Letter from Birmingham Jail over Easter weekend in 1963. Meanwhile, marches are being organized in Birmingham, organized from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, to try to call attention to the general plight that African Americans face in Birmingham, the injustice, injustice of the situation. And Bull Connor responds, quite famously, “I want to see the dogs work,” and then, “Look at those niggers run.”  As marches are organized, he would release the dogs, order his deputies to release the dogs. You’ve seen the images, of course. Open up the fire cannons. They actually had a tank, a police tank, that was brought out to terrorize the citizens. A decision is made by King and his circle to raise the stakes. And by raising the stakes, that means using children.\nBy the end of the first day, children marching in defiance of orders, leaving school, a thousand children aged between six, six and eighteen are thrown in jail. By the next day, the number doubles. Robert F. Kennedy, he was leading a civil rights agenda for his brother, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy is beside himself. He could not believe that King would risk these children’s lives, as he put it, for the sake of more media coverage, more negative press. This is what he was doing, there’s no doubt about it, that King is trying to antagonize the situation and horrify the nation by revealing what Bull Connor would actually do, and Bull Connor took the bait. He doesn’t care. Birmingham becomes a media circus, as people from around the country are horrified at what they bear witness to. With all the media around, a truce is negotiated. Lunch counters open to blacks, they become integrated. Promises are made that blacks are going to begin–going to get hired in clerical and sales positions, thus avoiding economic boycotts.\nBut that doesn’t mean there’s peace. Martin Luther King’s brother’s house is bombed. The hotel that was a staging ground for a lot of the organizers, who were coming in from out of town, the hotel was bombed. Federal troops, Robert F. Kennedy convinces his brother, “You’ve got to bring federal troops if you want to have stability.”  So federal troops come and occupy Birmingham to keep the peace. While all of this is going on, to speak of the sort of the heightened tension around various hotspots in the South and local and states’ rights versus federal rights, James Meredith, a few months earlier, inspired by Kennedy’s election and inauguration, applies for and is accepted at Old Miss, the flagship school in Mississippi, where Mississippi’s elite get trained. James Meredith, a black man of course, integrates the school, but only with federal protection, but the federal protection didn’t matter, since there were riots on campus surrounding Meredith’s arrival. His likeness is hung in effigy and federal marshals are killed.\nChapter 3. John Kennedy Pushes for a Civil Rights Bill [00:16:45]\nGeorge Wallace, governor of Alabama, who you saw in an advanced stage of his life in the documentary, who when he was running for election earlier in his career and lost, when he was a moderate Democrat, lost to a race a, you know, a, a race-wielding demagogue, declared earlier that he would never be “out-niggered” again, and becomes this creature, spewing racism and populism at every turn. Wallace, at his inauguration, declares, “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.”  In June of Sixty-Three, after the riots in Birmingham, Wallace participates in a staged act of resistance. He knows he’s going to lose it already, but he goes through this performance, and he refuses to let the University of Alabama be integrated. And he literally stands at the doorway of the, I think, the registrar’s offices, he’s outside of the building, refusing to let these two black students integrate University of Alabama. JFK knew about it. He’d already dispatched people to negotiate a situation, and the federal government, embodied in I think is Nick Katzenbach, essentially gets the students in the school. So the federal government is now intervening in state affairs in ways that, that could lead to, without exaggeration, another kind of sectional crisis.\nThat night, the same night that Wallace is moved aside and the University of Alabama is integrated, John F. Kennedy appears on national TV. And he asks, [clears throat] excuse me, he asks for Congress to give him legislation that would give everyone the right to be served in facilities that are open to the public. He declares–essentially asking for a civil rights bill. He declares, and I quote here, “We are confronted, excuse me, we are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and yet as clear as the American Constitution,” linking the battle that he wants to fight, asking Congress to give him the tools to fight, a battle that is one, bound up in the Constitution, but is also bound up with fundamental morality and an ethical sense of life. Astonishing for a President to step out like that, so astonishing that a man named Byron de la Beckwith, a white guy down in Mississippi, snaps. And hours after Kennedy–this is broadcast nationally on the news–hours after Kennedy makes this declaration, Byron de la Beckwith is hiding behind some bushes across the street from Medgar Evers’s house, Medgar Evers being the, the head of NAACP in Mississippi. He wanted to be also involved in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, but they made him pick and choose, so he chose the NAACP. Byron de la Beckwith shoots Medgar Evers from a high-powered rifle, kills him, the driveway of his home.\nBeckwith is not sentenced for thirty-five years. It’s part of a whole other conversation we might have at the end of the course about what some might call a generation in the South trying to find racial healing, decades after the events that these atrocities happen. So JFK goes on TV and says the federal government needs to respond to this moral failing in our country. Medgar Evers is murdered. In due course, a civil rights bill is introduced that would outlaw segregation in all interstate public accommodations. It would allow the attorney general to initiate suits for school integration. And, very importantly, it would give the attorney general power, the power to stop funding for any federal program where discrimination is found to have occurred. It’s a bill that’s mostly about enforcement, saying the federal government can get involved via the attorney general enforcing substantive and real change, along the lines of civil rights.\nChapter 4. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom [00:21:50]\nKing, as the head of SCLC, leaders of CORE, Congress of Racial Equality, NAACP, SNCC, the National Urban League, come together. It’s a group that squabbles quite a bit, but they come together and they are committed to seeing this bill actually pass. And they declare, much like A. Philip Randolph–well exactly like A. Philip Randolph declared some twenty-two years earlier, they call for a March on Washington. Kennedy went apoplectic. He goes, “This kind of agitating is going to kill any chance that the civil rights bill is going to pass. You have to be calm and quiet, you know. It’s not so much a go slow mentality, but just be calm. Don’t agitate. Don’t stir up the water.”  Kennedy is simply horrified. But the civil rights leaders have no intention of backing down. The march happens at the very end of August 1963, August twenty-eighth. Just over a month before the march, Kennedy relents and actually endorses it. So Kennedy’s trying for a solid month, month and a half, to get the march canceled quietly, you know, working with these civil rights leaders. It’s now quite customary for the President to be talking with civil rights leaders, something that was revolutionary in 1941. You know, they’re now called into the White House with regularity, or they’re just talking to him on the phone.\nKennedy realizes they’re not going to back down; he decides to endorse the march. But he endorses it on a couple of terms: that the federal government will have control over it, in the sense of, if things get out of line, we’ll kill the sound system. We reserve the right to look at all the speeches before they’re actually given. You know, they, they’re saying from a peace and safety standpoint that it’s really about trying to control this march so it doesn’t get out of hand in the federal government’s terms. Now it’s important to think of the march–we know a lot about it from our, you know, our civics classes in high school, and certainly it’s part of our sort of national rhetoric of exceptionalism, but there’s a lot of things we don’t know about the march, that they don’t talk about.\nFirst of all, just the name itself, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Jobs was a major part of the March on Washington. It’s not just King standing up there talking about a dream he’s having. It’s labor movements, religious organizations, civil rights organizations, working together, calling for the passage of the civil rights bill, calling for a two dollar minimum wage, calling for the immediate desegregation of schools, calling for a federal public works program, along the lines of New Deal works program I talked about a couple of weeks ago, calling for, calling for real federal action to ban discrimination in employment, not just press conferences like the FEPC used to do, but real action. So the goals of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, passage of civil rights bill, minimum wage, desegregated schools, public works program, and real federal action to ban discrimination in employment.\nThe march is remembered, of course, as a benevolent, benevolent and transcendent moment, but if you’ve already done your reading in, in the Marable and Mullings book, you’ll know that the story’s a little more complicated than that. John Lewis, currently representative of Congress, then the new head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis has a chance to go to the microphone, he prepares a speech, the original version of which is in your text. It is not a speech about love and joy, rainbows and unicorns, and all that kind of lovely stuff. It’s a speech that called out on the Kennedy–blamed the Kennedy government for its moral failings. It attacked the very hand that, in a sense, “allowed” the march to go forward. And in many people’s opinions, even if they agreed with Lewis, they’re saying, “There’s no way that you can actually say this, cause you will antagonize to the point, we will, this will kill the civil rights bill.” And Lewis goes, “I’m going to say what I’m going to say.” \nAs word of that gets leaked out to people who are about to go on up to the podium, one of the religious leaders, Cardinal, Cardinal–whose name, last name I’m blanking on. I’m thinking of other cardinals in the news for other reasons, the last few years–a, a cardinal says, “I’ll leave the podium if you say this.”  Walter Reuther says, “If you say this, I’m gone.”  Basically, at the moment at–just before the, the speakers go live, there’s a real chance the whole thing is going to fall apart. Lewis finally agrees to give an edited version of the speech, and that’s the speech that he gives. And the people out in the audience have no idea about what’s happened behind stage. They also don’t know, mainly because of what Lewis is threatening to do, that the administration had positioned agents by the loudspeakers, control panels, to kill the entire sound system, to silence the march. And who knows what would have happened, had that actually gone forward.\nChapter 5. Martin Luther King, Jr: “I Have a Dream” [00:27:49]\nSo the narrative behind the march itself, and, the, the, the how you get to the march actually happening and what’s actually said there, is, is different than what people normally have been taught to consume. What they’ve been taught to consume is this:\n[Martin Luther King, Jr:] So even though we face difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\nI have a dream today!”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  You all know these, this passage. Whether you know it by heart or not is a different issue. In a couple of weeks, when we, the course resumes, when we’re getting into the 1980s and nineties and such, we’ll come back to this last part of this. I wanted to play this main section here, because the last part is actually used for different, quite different purposes, as we get into the 1990s, in a new era of, sort of race politics, a confusing era all the same. But in this moment, this is, I mean it’s gorgeous. This beautiful passage about a person having a reverie about possibility, thinking about a day in which the color of their skin is not going to determine their life chances. I have no quarrel with celebrating this part of the speech, certainly. But what of other parts of the speech?  How come we don’t know a part, very early on, five paragraphs into his speech, when he says:\n“In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ‘unalienable Rights” of Law–of ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.’ It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’”\nThat’s a very–I mean imagine if that was the message that we grew up in our elementary schools listening to in black history month, as we all know, it’s been trotted out during that particular month. That’s a very different message to walk away from with the March on Washington: America has failed on its promise to provide equality for all its citizens, and it’s couched in the terms of capital. Significantly different speech if you just excerpt that part. Or, what if you excerpted this part?\n[Martin Luther King, Jr.:] We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: ‘For Whites Only.’ We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ‘justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.’”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Now that’s in the middle of his speech, as he’s preparing for the crescendo that would turn into the “I Have a Dream” sort of call and response, in a sense. So you have a King in the earliest part of this speech talking about the failures of the American republic to abide by its own Declaration of Independence and its own Constitution. The message hasn’t changed from the night before the March on–excuse me, the Montgomery bus boycott, when King says, “If we’re wrong in all of what we’re doing, the Supreme Court is wrong and the Constitution is wrong.” He’s calling for the country to live up to its legal mandates and, of course, its ethical mandates as well. And he’s also, although he certainly abides by the philosophy of turning the other cheek, it should not be allowed to be mistaken for sort of the positive and hopeful reverie of the “I Have a Dream moment.”  He is saying we cannot be satisfied, we cannot stop, harkening back, I think, to Du Bois who–W. E. B. Du Bois, who died the day before the March on Washington. Talk about, sort of, theatrical timing, not to make light of it. It’s rather astonishing though. He died an expatriate in Ghana, having essentially been kicked out of–well kicked himself out of the country, after the country took his passport for a while, for his alleged communist sympathizing.\nBut Du Bois was talking about “returning, returning from fighting, returning fighting” and King is saying the same thing, “We can never be satisfied,” as long as you can’t vote in Mississippi and as long as there’s no reason to vote in New York. And he’s harkening, by the way, at that moment, to the fact that–you know, I’ve been talking about the South a lot, and I will be talking about the South some more. But as we’ll see later in a couple of weeks, this is a national problem. It’s just articulated in different ways. So what would the narrative of the “I Have a Dream” speech be, if the title was: “We Can Never Be Satisfied”?  Or if the title were: “Insufficient Funds”?  That’s a different kind of speech. And we need to think about the consequences of these naming conventions, of these excerpting conventions, of these ways that we learn about individuals like King who become mythic for every good reason, I don’t want to dismiss it, but become something other than what they might have been, if you just looked at their rhetoric, looked at their approach in a slightly different angle.\nChapter 6. Final Thoughts [00:36:25]\nAll that said, there’s no denying the fact that right after the march, there was this sort of giddy feeling of hope, of benevolence, of transcendence. I can’t rewrite history that way. There’s a sense of real change in the air, the change that is shattered or, excuse me, a sense that is shattered two weeks later when those four little girls are blown to bits in Birmingham. Now the King you hear in “I Have a Dream” or–speech or Montgomery bus boycott speech, is a King who is buoyant, hopeful, angry perhaps, concerned, but with a, a narrative power that suggests possibility in a positive way. Let me play a clip of a different King.\n[Martin Luther King, Jr.: ] “These children, unoffending, innocent, and beautiful, were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity. And yet they died nobly. They are the martyred heroines of a holy crusade for freedom and human dignity. And so this afternoon in a real sense they have something to say to each of us in their death. They have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. They have something to say to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism. They have something to say to a federal government that has compromised with the undemocratic practices of southern Dixiecrats and the blatant hypocrisy of right-wing northern Republicans. They have something to say to every Negro who has passively accepted the evil system of segregation and who has stood on the sidelines in a mighty struggle for justice. They say to each of us, black and white alike, that we must substitute courage for caution. They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers. Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream. And so my friends, they did not die in vain.”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  King giving the eulogy at the funeral honoring the four young girls who were blown, blown, blown up. This is a King you don’t hear much about, a King who’s despairing, who’s exhausted, and feels hopeless. It’s important to know that King ran through the whole vector of human emotion, certainly, and was on more than one occasion pushed to the limits. Other people, of course, pushed to the limits, acting out in different kinds of ways. I began today’s lecture playing a clip from We Shall Overcome, a song talking about–I mean doesn’t take much to read into it–overcoming those moments when you are taxed beyond belief. It’s an anthem of the movement; it’s a very important song. We know it. Even if you don’t know the words, you can fake sing through it. You know, people next to you can sing a little louder, cover up the fact you don’t know what the next line is. But you know how the tune goes, right?  But we don’t hear about other artists offering different interpretations of this moment. After the four young women are blown up, Nina Simone, a famous jazz artist, produces a protest song. It becomes one of her signature pieces, much like Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit. It’s a very long song. I’m going to play, you know, a portion of it. The lyrics should be clear enough, but I’ll actually show them up here as well. It’s called “Mississippi Goddam.”\n[Nina Simone: (singing)] “Alabama’s gotten me so upset\nTennessee made me lose my rest\nAnd everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam\nThis is a show tune\nBut the show hasn’t been written for it, yet\nHound dogs on my trail\nSchool children sitting in jail\nBlack cat cross my path\nI think every day’s gonna be my last\nLord have mercy on this land of mine\nWe all gonna get it in due time\nI don’t belong here\nI don’t belong there\nI’ve even stopped believing in prayer\nDon’t tell me\nI tell you\nMe and my people just about due\nI’ve been there so I know\nThey keep on saying ‘Go slow!’\nBut that’s just the trouble\n‘do it slow’\nWashing the windows\n‘do it slow’\nPicking the cotton\n‘do it slow’\nYou’re just plain rotten\n‘do it slow’\nYou’re too damn lazy\n‘do it slow’\nThe thinking’s crazy\n‘do it slow’\nWhere am I going\nWhat am I doing\nI don’t know\nI don’t know\nJust try to do your very best\nStand up be counted with all the rest\nFor everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam\nI made you thought I was kiddin’ didn’t we.\nPicket lines\nSchool boycotts\nThey try to say it’s a communist plot\nAll I want is equality\nfor my sister my brother my people and me\nYes you lied to me all these years\nYou told me to wash and clean my ears\nAnd talk real fine just like a lady\nAnd you’d stop calling me Sister Sadie\nOh but this whole country is full of lies\nYou’re all gonna die and die like flies\nI don’t trust you any more\nYou keep on saying ‘Go slow!’\n‘Go slow!’\nBut that’s just the trouble\n‘do it slow’\nDesegregation\n‘do it slow’\nMass participation\n‘do it slow’\nReunification\n‘do it slow’\nDo things gradually\n‘do it slow’\nBut bring more tragedy\n‘do it slow’\nWhy don’t you see it\nWhy don’t you feel it\nI don’t know\nI don’t know\nYou don’t have to live next to me\nJust give me my equality\nEverybody knows about Mississippi\nEverybody knows about Alabama\nEverybody knows about Mississippi Goddam\nThat’s it!”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Now it’s a genius song, and since it, you know, it’s played to the tune of a bouncy show tune and she was known for doing, you know, jazz standards and her own songs, playing the American songbook. And then she’s telling her largely white audiences to go to hell. And they ate it up. That, you know, she’s calling the people who expected civil rights activists to be respectable, wash behind their ears, to hell with that as well. And the beloved country that King is talking about, that can go to hell as well. In fact, it is going to hell, because they just blew up four children and no one’s going to pay the consequences for it. This is an important narrative of the Civil Rights Movement. You need to understand it. And you also need to understand the fact that it’s dropped out, and that’s really the, the significance of it all, is that we know certain things about the movement and not others, and we need to ask the question why. That brings to close my lecture. The TAs are going to fan out a little separately over here to distribute your papers and your midterm exams. And even though I know you have other classes to go to, I wish you a lovely spring break. Thanks.\n')
('african-american-studies', 'AFAM-162', 'lecture_16.txt', 'African American History: From Emancipation to the Present (2010)\nAFAM 162 - Lecture 16 - From Voting Rights to Watts\nChapter 1. Introduction: Reframing the Civil Rights Movement Iconic Figures [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Alright, why don’t we go ahead and get started. I’m going to beg your–Welcome back from spring break. I hope you all had a lovely time of it. I’ll apologize at the beginning. I have gotten sick right at the end of spring break, so if you can hear me in the back?  Is that, is that fine in the back?  Okay. I don’t have much more than this in the tank. Okay. Now, I know you’ve all done the reading for the week already and I know that you remember everything I was saying at the last minute before break, but just for my sake, I’ll just remind you that we were just wrapping up talking about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and the assassination of the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, essentially spending the time, much of our last week of lecture, dealing, dealing with these iconographic individuals and moments in Martin Luther King and the March on Washington, and trying to unravel a lot of the more familiar historiography or history around these individuals. What I want to do today is to continue in that work of reframing the Civil Rights Movement iconic figures and spend today’s lecture talking about Malcolm X.\nNow a couple of caveats, maybe just one caveat, to begin with is that for this week’s, this week’s lectures are going to be overlapping themselves, so that we have today talking about Malcolm X from say, well his, his biography essentially, till his assassination in sixty-five, and then on Wednesday, we’re going to go back over the time period between roughly ‘63 and ‘65. It’s the simplest way that I know of to make sure that we handle a new understanding of, of Malcolm X, or maybe a different understanding, and also make sure we get the events on the ground that are happening at the same time. So the chronology’s overlapping.\nChapter 2. A Sampling of Malcolm X’s Famous Rhetoric [00:01:42]\nOkay, with that explanation out of the way, let me begin with a sampling of Malcolm X’s famous rhetoric, and this one is following the March on Washington. So we’re talking about now in August of 1963. When asked about the March on Washington, Malcolm X replied or giving a, giving a speech–this is an excerpt from Message to the Grassroots:\n“No, it was a sellout. It was a takeover. When James Baldwin came in from Paris, they wouldn’t let him talk, because they couldn’t make him go by the script. Burt Lancaster read the speech that Baldwin was supposed to make; they wouldn’t let Baldwin get up there, because they know, they know Baldwin’s liable to say anything. They controlled it so tight —— they told those negroes what time to hit town, how to come, where to stop, what signs to carry, what song to sing, what speech they could make, and what speech they couldn’t make; and then told them to get out town by sundown. And every one of those Toms was out of town by sundown. Now I know you don’t like say–my saying this, but I can, I can back it up. It was a circus, a performance that beat anything Hollywood could ever do, the performance of the year. (Walter Reuther, labor leader) Walter Reuther and those other three devils should get a Academy Award for the best actors because they acted like they really loved negroes and fooled a whole lot of negroes. And the six negro leaders should get an award too, for the best supporting cast.”\nIt’s quite a statement. This is again from Message to the Grassroots, although he would respond to other people that the speech was nothing but a circus on other occasions, it’s delivered shortly before Malcolm X breaks with the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad. The reading for this week, one of the readings, Malcolm X Speaks, excerpts, a collection of, of talks edited by George Brightman, are all ex–speeches from Message to the Grassroots to the end of Malcolm X’s life, a, a time period that’s rather important for reasons you’ll see as the course of the lecture–over the course of this lecture. Now Malcolm X was famous for rhetoric like referring to the March on Washington as a circus and for other, other sort of notorious, infamous statements. I want to play a couple of other excerpts, because there’s nothing like hearing the person speaking. The first is from–and I’ll let the two speeches run together. You’ll, you’ll notice the break, definitely. The first is from The Ballot or the Bullet and the second is from The Black–The Black Revolution.\n[Malcolm X:]  This is why I say it’s the ballot or the bullet. It’s liberty or it’s death. It’s freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody. America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody. Oh, yes, they are. They haven’t ever had a blood-less revolution, or a non-violent revolution. That don’t happen even in Hollywood. You don’t have a revolution in which you love your enemy, and you don’t have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolutions overturn systems. Revolution destroys systems. A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She’s the only country in history in a position actually to become involved in a blood-less revolution. All she’s got to do is give the black man in this country everything that’s due him, everything. I hope that the white man can see this, because if you don’t see it you’re finished. If you don’t see it you’re going to be coming–you’re going to become involved in some action in which you don’t have a chance. And we don’t care anything about your atomic bomb; it’s, it’s useless because other countries have atomic bombs. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them, so it means that the white man today is without a weapon. If you’re going–if you want some action, you’ve got to come on down to Earth. And there’s more black people on Earth than there are white people on Earth. It’ll be–it’ll be the, the ballot or it’ll be the bullet. It’ll be liberty or it’ll be death. And if you’re not ready to pay that price, don’t use the word freedom in your vocabulary.”\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  That’s the end of the first clip. And the second clip begins right now.\n[Malcolm X:] “We should defend ourselves. And when I say we should defend ourselves against the violence of others, that if they use their press skillfully to make the world think that I’m calling on violence period, and I wouldn’t call on anybody to be violent without a cause. But I think the black man in this country, above and beyond people all over the world, will be more justified when he stands up and starts to protect himself, no matter how many necks he has to break or heads he has to crack.”\n[recording starts from beginning and you can hear the following] This is why I say it’s the ballot or the bullet.\nChapter 3. What was Unique about Malcolm X? [00:07:47]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  So it’s important to ask, when thinking about Malcolm X, and these–playing these excerpts, are we hearing a different kind of voice?  Are we hearing a different engagement or interpretation with the present moment, 1964?  Are we hearing a different agenda?  Is this what makes Malcolm X so different from Martin Luther King and other famous African American leaders?  Well, you know by now that what he’s asking for in The Ballot or the Bullet, the excerpt from the speech The Ballot or the Bullet, he’s asking for civil rights. He says there’s no need for a bloody revolution, certainly. All he’s asking is for that–for the black man what is due him, he says in the quote. Is he doing something new when he’s asking for these things?  You can go back to the Niagara Movement in 1905 and hear a lot of the same kinds of things that Malcolm X is seeking.\nOkay now the Niagara Movement wasn’t calling for violence upon violence, in, in response to violence, self-defense, not that way. So one might say well he was doing something new there. But even then, no. If you look back to Robert Williams in the 1950s, head of the NAACP chapter in North Carolina, something I’ve already brought up before and in your reader, he was calling for black men to, you know, gather up their arms and respond with force. So Malcolm X is talking really in a longer tradition, certainly a long tradition of calling for full civil rights and equality, and, and speaking in a long tradition as well, although much less talked about and much less consistent really, but always there, about violent self-defense, embracing violence, if, if this is–embracing self-defense, and if that means using violence, so be it.\nNow why is this lingering, worth lingering over?  It’s worth it because like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X’s life is frozen in time. We’ll be coming back next to King next week and you’ll–I’ll flesh out that statement more completely. But like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X is frozen in time. And really frozen in time incorrectly. Malcolm X’s life is encapsulated by just, you know, the phrase “By any means necessary.”  Certainly, gosh, I can’t remember how many years ago now, when Spike Lee’s film Malcolm X came out, there was just an amazing moment at the commodification of Malcolm X, embodied in really cool baseball caps with a white X on the front, or in t-shirt and such. And, you know, that’s how you kept it real, by walking around town wearing that kind of outfit, wearing Malcolm X, and his belief system, allegedly with an over–overpriced cap you’re wearing or the t-shirt. The fact is that the popularized, commodified image of Malcolm X is also one that’s out of date. In fact, by the end of his life, he was not even known as Malcolm X, and he distanced himself in an incremental fashion from a lot of his most famous declarations in the early 1960s.\nChapter 4. Who was Malcolm X? [00:11:35]\nSo who is then Malcolm X?  Let’s work through the biography. His birth name is Malcolm Little. He was born in 1925. He’s assassinated in February 1965, less than a year after he breaks from the Nation of Islam. Now this, this little fact is actually inconsequential, but it is funny the way we think about things, that Martin Luther King is the, you know, middle class, moderate, grownup and Malcolm X, the fiery, youthful ambassador to the Nation of Islam, in a sense. But Malcolm X is older than Martin Luther King by four years. I mean, yeah, it’s kind of inconsequential, but it actually speaks to the way in which we kind of remember these people in our minds. Both of them were very young men. So Malcolm Little is born in 1925. He’s known over the course of his life as Detroit Red, as Malcolm X most famously, and finally as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. He’s a child, a middle child, of eight. His father’s a Baptist minister, and an organizer for Marcus Garvey’s UNIA. There’s different versions about Malcolm X’s early life and you know, forgive me, I will, I will often use Malcolm X in this lecture, just out of old habits.\nThere’s not a whole bunch about Malcolm Little’s life. His father has died, either murdered by a Klan styled group in Michigan, the Black Legionnaires, or died an accidental death. In either case, Malcolm’s fatherless at age six. The family disintegrates. Malcolm Little drops out of school, moves to Boston and then to Harlem, and becomes a hustler. He’s running numbers, selling drugs, he’s pimping, and is a petty thief. During this era in his life, he’s adopted the street moniker as Detroit Red. At twenty-one–and I’ve just, and I’ve encapsulated, or sort of put parentheses around the first twenty-one years of his life in just that little biographical sketch–at twenty-one, he’s arrested and sent to prison for burglary and larceny. He’s given an eight to ten year sentence and ultimately serves six and a half years. He’s paroled in 1952, about twenty-seven years old. While he’s in prison, he has a religious conversion. He–while he’s in prison, he’s converted to the Nation of Islam, and adopts the name Malcolm X. The X is a reference to a long legacy of African Americans who were in an enslaved past who were given the master’s last name. And X is a, is a decoration that they are wiping out the slave name from their past, and they’re speaking to an unknown past, but claiming it as their own. [student sneezes] Bless you.\nAnyway, Malcolm X, now, is a member of the Lost Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America. That’s the full name. The Lost Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America. It’s a religious sect founded by a rather shadowy person, we really don’t know much about him at all, named Wallace Fard, founded around 1930. Fard disappears under curious circumstances. I’ve never seen anything convince–convincing of what actually happened to Fard, but one of the people he brought into his circle before he disappears is a janitor in Detroit, Michigan, in Detroit, Michigan named Elijah Poole. Elijah Poole becomes the spiritual head of the religious organization known as the Nation of Islam and renames himself Elijah Muhammad. Now the Nation of Islam is a very unorthodox version of traditional Islam. There’s barely any connection between the two in truth, at least at that moment in time. The Nation of Islam grafts together black nationalism and some Islamic fundamentals. Elijah Muhammad teaches, through the Nation of Islam, to his disciples, his followers. That Muhammad taught–excuse me, I lost my place in my notes here.\nMuhammad taught that whites were a mutant race of blue-eyed devils, created by, created by a mad black scientist to persecute black people. As the messenger of God, Elijah Muhammad would free his followers one day when Allah’s apocalyptic wrath finally destroyed whites. In the meantime, the black Muslims, followers of the Nation of Islam, the black Muslims would offer hope to blacks through self-discipline and self-help. So the Creation myth revolves around a, a crazed black scientist who fashions white to persecute blacks. Just as bizarre as any other Creation myth, I suppose, that’s out there. Anyway, this is what it is. And that black Muslims would, would be the population to help blacks through this time of struggle, through teaching self-discipline and self-help. This is one of the reasons the Nation of Islam is so traditionally–been so powerful at, or so successful at, converting people who are in prison. Teaching self discipline and self help, being those things that are most desperately needed, often, by those who are in prison, after all. Teaching race pride as well, independence.\nAnyway, shortly after his release from prison, Malcolm X meets Elijah Muhammad and becomes an assistant minister in Detroit temple number one. This is where the Nation is headquartered. Malcolm X, despite the interesting ways he’s been historicized, one cannot deny the fact that he’s an incredibly charismatic speaker, powerful speaker. Elijah Muhammad recognizes this and very quickly sends Malcolm X to, to Harlem, and establishes him as the minister of the Harlem temple. And although it’s not the headquarters of the Nation of Islam, because it’s in Harlem, sort of black Manhattan, it very quickly becomes the most important temple. And Elijah Muhammad asks, asks Malcolm X to be his–the national spokesman for the Nation of Islam. So very quickly, Malcolm X goes from jail to meeting Elijah Muhammad, to becoming assistant minister at the Detroit temple, to becoming the head of the Harlem temple, to becoming the spokesman for the Nation of Islam, although he’s not the head of the Nation of Islam.\nUnder Malcolm X’s charismatic leadership, the Nation of Islam grows exponentially. It’s really very small in the 1950s. It grows from several hundred followers to over ten thousand by the early 1960s. Still rather small, of course. As Malcolm X continues to speak and advocate, the membership grows and new temples are established. Radio stations are purchased. Stores are opened up. The Nation of Islam in their early 1960s, late fifties, early sixties, is tapping into a growing disaffection within black America, particularly urban and northern black America. This is a movement that is overwhelmingly northern at this point in time. The Steel Belt, Steel Belt, thinking along the, the northern, middle west of the United States, Ohio and Pittsburgh, heading across to Michigan, is becoming the Rust Belt, going through a period of deindustrialization. The jobs that caused blacks to migrate north to the–after the Second World War are going away and they’re stuck in crumbling ghettoes.\nAnd the rhetorical flair of Malcolm, I’m sorry of Martin Luther King’s speeches–this is also the period of King’s greatest triumphs–aren’t doing anything to change the daily quality, quality of life for most blacks, particularly those living outside of the South. So if you’re stuck in a slum apartment in Detroit, Michigan or Chicago, Illinois, the powerful rhetoric that’s coming from King and the struggles in Birmingham, Montgomery, and other places, they aren’t putting food on your table, they aren’t changing what happens when you look for a job. Malcolm X’s rhetoric isn’t necessarily putting food on the table, but when you marry the rhetoric with the establishment of these temples and stores, Nation of Islam stores, and laundries–if you think back to Marcus Garvey’s UNIA, black owned, entrepreneurial opportunities, serving a black community–that’s what the Nation of Islam is doing as well. If you tap into—if, if you are, are listening to Malcolm X’s rhetoric and actually going to a temple, then maybe going to a store, you’re finding yourself in a community that will help you.\nSo Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam are tapping into something sort of festering, disillusioned urban slum dwellers. There’s growing skepticism in black America about the worth of integrating into the white mainstream, with James Baldwin famously saying, “Why would I want to integrate into a burning house?”  There’s a growing increase in support for violent methods to solve problems and a surge in nationalist sentiment among African Americans not seen since the Garvey years, since the height of the Garvey movement in the nineteen-teens and the 1920s. All of these things working together are increasing the numbers in the Nation of Islam, developing a broader support base. Now the Nation is a religious organization and was steadfast in its refusal to get involved in contemporary electoral politics, very different from Southern Christian Leadership Conference, for example, SNCC, other organizations.\nThe Nation is a religious organization. Had a very conservative social view, very much along the lines of Booker T. Washington’s notions of self-help. It is racially separatist. It’s not embracing any of the integrating logics of, of SNCC at that point, or NAACP, or other groups. Malcolm X, in fact, had represented Elijah Muhammad in the Nation in negotiations with the national heads of the KKK and the American Nazi Party. Thinking back to Marcus Garvey, believing that the head of the Klan was the most honest white man in America. You have the same kind of mentality being expressed in the Nation of Islam. But all is not well with the Nation of Islam either. There are whisperings, as we get into the early 1960s, that Elijah Muhammad and the allegations he’s having affairs with teenage members of the Nation, whisperings he’s actually impregnated several members of the Nation, and then publicly rebuked the same young women for fornication, never naming himself in the process and getting them thrown out of the Nation. There have been whisperings for a long time about financial improprieties, and there’s an increasing sense of frustration, certainly felt by Malcolm X, but also by other members of the Nation, that coming down from Elijah Muhammad is a steadfast refusal to get involved in the politics of the day. There’s also a tension created by the fact that Malcolm X is increasingly popular and although he’s not the leader of the Nation, because he is the spokesperson for the Nation, he is seen as embodying the Nation.\nSo we’re in 1963. John F. Kennedy is assassinated in November, and Malcolm X, because he is such a prominent individual in the Nation, was asked what he thought about this moment, this moment of great national tragedy, and white and black Americans are devastated that the seeming prince of a person had been cut down. And Malcolm X very famously says, “It was merely a case of the chickens coming home to roost.”  That’s a response that Malcolm X meant to use to highlight the fact that JFK lived by the sword, and he was quite a saber-rattler as a President, that he lived by the sword and therefore he was going to die by it. Whether Malcolm X’s comment made any sense or not, it was a comment that horrified the country. Elijah Muhammad saw this as an opportunity, as it turns out. He is getting feedback, whisperings as well, that Malcolm X is becoming too popular, that Malcolm X is, is growing away from the Nation and from Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad is concerned about his ability to control Malcolm X.\nChapter 5. Malcolm X Breaks Away from the Nation of Islam [00:27:34]\nSo Muhammad jumps on this opportunity and silences Malcolm X for ninety days, based on that comment. He was not allowed to represent the Nation of Islam and not to speak on the Nation’s behalf. Now from a standpoint of public policy, it made perfect sense. I mean, this is such a, a moment of anger, folks on the Nation of Islam, that to have anything less than silenced Malcolm X would have been, would have been seen as to support this notion of chickens coming home to roost. But the truth really does lie elsewhere in terms of Elijah Muhammad’s anxiety, growing anxiety about Malcolm X and his popularity, and also because Malcolm X had confronted Muhammad about his affairs, that he’d heard that these things were happening. He was waiting for Elijah Muhammad to refute them, and he never could. Financial improprieties, he couldn’t refute those either. During this moratorium, this ninety day silence, it becomes clear to Malcolm X that his silence, his ban on public speaking would not be lifted, and so he breaks from the Nation of Islam.\nHis speech, Message to the Grassroots, which I spoke from at the beginning of the lecture, it’s one of the last speeches he gives before he breaks from the Nation. And if you look back at it, you can see sort of the handwriting on the wall, because peppered throughout Malcolm X’s declarations would be, you know, that he speaks on behalf of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. “As the honorable Elijah Muhammad says,”  “The honorable, honorable Elijah Muhammad believes” this that and the other. He can’t say it in this speech. He’s growing apart. So the split becomes official in March of 1964. Malcolm X establishes a religious organization called the Muslim Mosque Incorporated, and a political organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unity, thus reflecting, or creating, this two headed–or maybe these two organizations on, on separate paths. Certainly embodying a belief by Malcolm X that broad social engagement provided blacks the best chance for ending racism, not just a set of personal belief systems, but also engaging the battle on the ground. This was the political aspect of the OAAU, the Organization, Organization of Afro-American Unity that Malcolm X felt was lost–a lost opportunity for the Nation of Islam.\nBefore establishing the OAAU, Malcolm X makes a hajj, a religious journey to Mecca, and during that trip has a stunning change of heart on race relations. Very famously in the autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haey, you see Malcolm X talking about meeting Muslims who were whiter than the whitest person he’d seen in the United States, blue eyes and blond hair. He had a very sort of immature notion of what traditional Muslim–Islamic faith was like and what Muslims would, quote, look like, even. So whites are no longer the blue-eyed devil in Malcolm X’s view. His outlook, his political, religious, and ethical outlook, which certainly is revolutionary while he’s with the Nation of Islam, becomes increasingly anti-capitalist. And this is something we’re going to see, not just in Malcolm X’s belief system, but in other leaders’ belief systems, as we head into the mid and late 1960s. Anti-capitalist thinking and rhetoric becomes much more important and is certainly a string that ties a lot of these individuals together, although that linkage is often not talked about.\nHe rejects his prior views on race. He rejects the idea of black separatism. He rejects his anti-Semitism. He rejects his opposition to intermarriage. All of these are views that he espoused while in the Nation of Islam. He comes to recognize that women actually did have an important role to play in the political struggle. And he begins to accept and look for–accept the idea of and look for alliances of black organizations with other groups committed to revolutionary change. This is a complete change of heart. His prior views on race, race separatism, his, his notion of the role Jews played in the world system, his anti-Semitic views, his opposition to intermarriage, all of those are gone. Women might have a role in the struggle. Whites are no longer blue-eyed devils. There could be other organizations blacks could relate to, attach themselves to, as long as they’re working towards revolutionary change. In the end, Malcolm X acknowledged that his political views are rapidly evolving, embodied in the fact that he no longer goes by Malcolm X. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name he adopts during this last conversion.\nHe admits, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, that–when asked, that he was hard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which he thought was necessary for the liberation of black people in the United States. He didn’t know at this point what the right answer was. This is between middle of sixty-four and early 1965. Now Malcolm X is assassinated in February of 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam. There’s been rumor mills running nonstop since then about who was really behind the assassination, I mean, beyond the folks who actually pulled the triggers. But was it a man now known as Louis Farrakhan, someone scrambling for attention from Elijah Muhammad, who inspired or gave directions to the, the, the murderers?  Was it the FBI infiltrating the NOI, to find a way to assassinate Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, although he’s no longer part of the Nation of Islam?  The debate’s been going on really, I mean, through the very recent past, during bizarre sets of events that leads to some sort of reconciliation, I suppose, with Louis Farrakhan and Malcolm X’s–one of his daughters or grand?–must be daughters, I suppose, and Louis Farrakhan saying that, you know, he apologizes if someone had misinterpreted his views or ideas in such a way that they might–thought it might be okay to assassinate Malcolm X, one of these squirrelly kind of apologies. Fact of the matter remains that Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, is murdered February 1965.\nChapter 6. Malcolm X’s Legacy [00:36:14]\nWhat does he leave behind?  He leaves behind no great leadership legacy, but in terms of, you know, what organization was left, what did he do, he’d broken from the organization that had defined most of his life, his adult life. The OAAU and the Muslim Mosque Incorporated at the moment of his assassination were really inchoate. His views were shifting. He couldn’t answer the question, what is going to be the most successful means to liberating black Americans?  He didn’t know the answer. But we, you know, it’s, even though he leaves no clear leadership legacy behind, can he be judged by normal standards of his leadership–by normal standards of leadership?  His martyrdom, as it turns out, gives him–gave him his legitimacy. Critics have said that his emotionalism, his powerful rhetoric, that he, he relied on it to win his cases and it’s also an emotionalism that, four years down the line, three and four years down the line, lent themselves perfectly well to the orthodoxies of the late 1960s, something we’ll see in next week’s reading, Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice.\nSo his ideas were, you know, the, the, you know, the phrase is sort of nonsensical, you know, a person ahead of his time, the ideas that become popularized, that were popular when Malcolm X was alive, become popularized after his death, become the vehicle for establishing sort of a logic, organizational logic, for groups, that really don’t even exist when Malcolm X is alive. Now martyrdom, certainly a major element of the Civil Rights Movement. In the time that remains, I want to actually segue from this Malcolm X biography and, because we have so much to cover on Wednesday, shift gears a little bit and start talking about events going backward over the last couple of years of Malcolm X’s life, that spring from the, the phenomenon, the phenomena of martyrdom, what it does for people, or for a race in this case. This is an era of martyrdom, you have Kennedy assassinated, November 22nd, 1963. Then Johnson’s now the President and calls for the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Act, something that was simmering on the table at the moment of John F. Kennedy’s assassination. And Johnson commits himself for the rest of his time in office to fulfilling Kennedy’s legacy on this agen–on this score. That’s in sixty-three.\nLittle earlier than that, before Kennedy was assassinated–and this gets us to, if time permits, right to this moment of this, a sec–another martyrdom, the Students–Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, starts working on voter registration drives and organizes with other, with other, gathers together with other organizations to have what’s called a freedom vote, the fall of sixty-three. Plans are developed sixty-two for the fall of sixty-three, with the goal of proving one, that blacks are interested in voting. This is all happening in Mississippi, an important fact I just left out. I just remembered, sorry. The goal is to prove that blacks are interested in voting and to develop the practice for the eventual day when blacks in Mississippi might get the right to vote, helping develop the culture of voting for blacks in Mississippi. This turns into Freedom Summer, 1964. So now again we’re back after King’s assass–Kennedy’s assassination.\nThe goal of the Freedom Summer of sixty-four is to organize a real party, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, to establish freedom schools throughout Mississippi, sites literally of training Mississippi youth the basics of education, literacy being one of the basic elements of freedom schools, but also creating community centers for poor blacks to come to get food, to get clothing, and also to develop a political consciousness about the future–about the present, thinking about the future. In June of sixty-four, June twentieth, first wave of recruits comes down to help make Freedom Summer a reality. It’s people your age, people from Yale who are your age, are among the recruits, quite famously, a lot of them, coming from college campuses in the North and the Midwest and the West coast, coming to Mississippi to try to create real change in Mississippi, in, in Mississippi. On June twenty-first, the day after Mississippi Freedom Summer begins,  three workers disappear, Freedom Party workers. Andrew Goodman, a twenty-year-old from New York City, Michael Schwerner, a twenty-five-year-old from Brooklyn, and James Chaney, a twenty-one-year-old black Mississippian. Two white men and one black man.\nThey’re arrested for speeding, a fairly common offense used by the police. Speeding, you know it didn’t matter what speed you were actually going; they just arrested you for it. They were released that night, but understanding that, in Mississippi, they’re dealing with infrastructure of police terror. The organizers for the meet–Mississippi Freedom Summer had a process that if you, if you get arrested at all, that you check in. If you’re out in the field, you check in at normal intervals. Well, Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney did not check in at the appointed time, or within fifteen minutes of the appointed time. This sends out alarms. Compressing a lot of history here, but based on their disappearance, LBJ sends in sailors, Navy divers, to start drag–dredging swamps, looking for Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney. There’s no doubt that they were killed. They’ve just go to find them now. What is quite horrific in the process of looking for Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney is that the divers don’t find them, but they start pulling up other black bodies that had long gone missing in Mississippi and in other states.\nQuite a state of affairs. During the summer, up in Washington, D.C., there’s frantic attempts to organize the Congress, to break filibusters in the Senate, to get the Civil Rights bill signed into law. And on July 2nd, in 1964, Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon Johnson succeeds. It’s the most far reaching Civil Rights bill in history at that point, and it gives the attorney general tremendous power. And the power, essentially, to enforce what is already on the books in many places. It provides for full access in places of public accommodation, establishes a permanent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It says there’s going to be no discrimination in federally funded programs, something that really becomes important, I mean it’s important immediately, but becomes part of the debate in the–up to our present day, in fact. Now the Civil Rights Act signed into law in July sixty-four, it’s largely irrelevant to Mississippi blacks. Despite all the work of the Mississippi Freedom Summer activists, and their success at establishing the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, essentially an alternative to the Democratic Party in Mississippi, the fact is, the chance for blacks to actually vote through, quote, normal channels, official channels, is essentially nonexistent.\nStill in the summer, Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney have been disappeared, the Civil Rights bill is passed but is meaningless to Mississippi. There are fights within Mississippi’s state delegation, within the state government, about trying to silence the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Democrats are heading towards a convention in August for the Democratic Party. The question is bubbling about what is going to happen in Mississippi, which group of delegates are going to be recognized. Will it be the official delegates of the Democratic Party in Mississippi or will it be the delegates of the Freedom Democratic Party?  LBJ is facing a threat that five other southern states would walk away if the Democratic Party–from the convention if the Democratic Party from Mississippi, the “official delegation,” is not seated at the convention. And on August fourth, three weeks before the convention, the bodies of Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney are found in an earthen dam, near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Philadelphia, Mississippi.\nThe bodies are riddled with thirty-eight caliber bullets. Chaney, sole black man, his head is, I’m sorry, his skull is fractured. He had suffered a savage beating. Mississippi law refused to allow the three men to be buried side by side, as they wished, as their families wished. Chaney had to be buried in a segregated cemetery. Eventually, twenty-one whites are arrested, including the deputy sheriff, all released by a state court. Eventually, six put on–into jail for violating federal civil rights laws, are given three to six years. David Dennis, the head of Mississippi’s CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, when asked to give a eulogy for James Chaney, agrees to do so and to give a calming eulogy. When he gets in front of the crowd, in this moment of profound emotional turmoil and political turmoil, wrestling with the martyrdom of these three men, he snaps and says something quite off the script, and that’s exactly where we’ll pick up on Wednesday.\n')
('african-american-studies', 'AFAM-162', 'lecture_17.txt', 'African American History: From Emancipation to the Present (2010)\nAFAM 162 - Lecture 17 - From Voting Rights to Watts (continued)\nChapter 1. Mississippi Freedom Summer [00:00:00]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  What I’d like to do today is go back very briefly so we’re all on the same page, moving from events in 1964 through 1966 actually. I’m trying to compress some information so we can really be ready to catch next week right where we should be. Remember in the last lecture, I talked about the events leading up to this pivotal summer of 1964, John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon Baines Johnson taking up the mantle of Kennedy’s civil rights legis–legislation, the battles over the civil rights bill, a bill being essentially stuck in Congress, especially the Senate filibuster, student leaders from SNCC conceptualizing the idea for a Freedom Summer, freedom vote to train people how to become–how to fully embrace their rights as citizens in the state of Mississippi, setting up freedom schools. These things all come together in the summer of 1964.\nStudents from all around the country, Yale included, travel down to various points in Mississippi to begin Mississippi Freedom Democratic–Mississippi, Mississippi Freedom Summer, set up freedom schools, help organize votes to create a, a separate delegation to the Mississippi Democratic–to represent the Mississippi, Mississippi Democratic Party at the Democratic national convention in August. And the day after Mississippi Freedom Summer begins, three of the workers, Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney, disappear and are very quickly presumed to have been murdered. During the course of the summer, the Civil Rights Act of sixty–the Civil Rights Act is passed, signed into law, the most comprehensive law in support of racial equality in the nation’s history. There was an immediate white backlash. George Wallace declares, the governor of Alabama, declares his candidacy. Ultimately has strong showings in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Maryland. Public places in the South go private in order to prevent integration. Civil Rights Act had not addressed the private institutions.\nIt’s a long summer of riots in 1964. Riots aren’t just in southern U.S. In fact, they’re largely urban and northern: New York City; Rochester; Paterson, New Jersey; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Chicago. It’s a time of trial. And as you’ll recall from my lecture on Monday as I was wrapping it up, weeks before the Democratic National Convention convenes, the bodies of Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney are found, August 4th. And they become martyrs of the movement, there’s no doubt about it. It’s really important that you know that they were found in Philadelphia, Mississippi, for reasons that become very important later on in this course. The bodies are found in an earthen dam in Philadelphia, Mississippi. There was an aspiration to have them buried together, but Mississippi state law said the races had to be buried in separate spaces.\nDavid Dennis, the head of CORE in Mississippi, agrees to give a eulogy in honor of James Chaney, the sole African American of these, of these three people who were murdered. And he agrees to do it and then he sits down to do it and something happens. I want to play for you a clip. It’s a three minute long clip. It’s a little bit longer than I normally like to play, but you’ll actually see the transformation happen during the course of the eulogy.\n[Narrator:]  August 7th, 1964. The funeral of James Chaney in Meridien, Mississippi.\n<>\n[David Dennis:]  I feel that he’s got his freedom and we’re still fighting for it. But what I want to talk about right now is the living dead that we have right among our midst, not only in the state of Mississippi, but throughout the nation. Those are the people who don’t care, those who do care but don’t have the guts enough to sign up for it, and those people who are busy up in Washington and other places using my freedom and my life to play politics with. That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi. In my opinion, as I stand here, I not only blame the people who pulled the trigger or did the beating or dug the hole with the shovel, I bury the peace, but not up there with God. But I blame the people in Washington, D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger. You see, I know what’s going to happen. I feel that even if they find the people who killed those guys in the summertime, you got to come back to the state of Mississippi and have a jury, all their cousins, their aunts, their uncles. And I know what they’re going to say, ‘not guilty’ because no one saw them pull the trigger. I’m tired of that. See, another thing that makes me even tireder, though, that is the fact that we as people here in the state and the country are allowing this to continue to happen, even us as black folk. So I look at the young kids here, that’s something else that I grieve about. And little Ben Chaney here and the other ones like him around in this audience. Well if you want someone to babysit for your kids, hire a black mammy to hold your baby. And as long as he can do that, he can sit down beside me, he can watch me go up there and register to vote, and he can watch me take some <> in this state and he can sit down as I rule over him just as he’s ruled over me for years. This is our country, too. We didn’t ask to come here; they brought us over here.\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway: It’s cut off at the last bit there, but he simply reiterates, “this is our country too.”  Asked about this eulogy afterwards, Dave Dennis said he looked down–he was planning to abide by the rules and give sort of a calming and reassuring, mournful and certainly angry, but in a polite sort of way, mournful eulogy. And he looked down at Ben Chaney and he just snapped, “because I can’t do this any longer.”  What you see happening in sixty-four and you’ll see more in sixty-five as well, is a fundamental shift in the tone of the movement. This is really one of the most important things to understand about this moment in the movement’s history. You also see in the wake of great triumphs of the movement, like the Civil Rights Act being signed–there’s no mistaking it’s a triumph–you also see a very clear tactical shift in the movement, and that’s what this lecture really is about, the fundamental tone and tactical changes in the movement that happened in the, in the sixty-four, sixty-five moment.\nFrom the standpoint of tactics, it’s clear to Johnson and to others–Lyndon Johnson and to others–that by signing in the Civil Rights Act, he was kissing away the Democratic Party in the South. This is the, this is the real fear. And the only Democrats who were going to vote for him were African American Democrats. From the highest levels of political government, organized government, the notion is, “you’ve got to get these black folks registered.”  Well, as it happened–at least for the Democratic Party. On the ground, that’s the agenda as well for people in Mississippi, people who were working on Mississippi Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. So the Freedom–MFDP, Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, an attempt by white and black activists in Mississippi, with support from other places, to set up a slate of candidates to run as the alternate to the Mississippi Democratic delegation, that would ultimately be seated at the, at the Democratic National Convention.\nThe vice chair of the MFDP, a very famous activist named Fannie Lou Hamer. Fannie Lou Hamer was the youngest of twenty children, sharecropper all of her life, no education after the third grade, but had powerful presence, incredibly eloquent, captivating speaker. And sadly, part of what made her so captivating is the story she had to tell was nightmarish. When I say that, you know, she was in school to the third grade, the schools were only open for three or four months, because the rest of the time you were working in the fields. Well, as other SNCC activists and SCLC activists come to, to Mississippi, they meet this  person they’ve been hearing about, Ms. Hamer, and she begins to be inspired by them and starts to try to organize voters on her own. She’s harassed by the police. People would call all day and night on her home telephone number to the point she had to just take the phone off the receiver. Threats with her losing her job, threats against her life, but she’s unfazed. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party is more than just her, but she embodies so much of it.\nAs they’re marching to the Democratic National Convention, the debate is which Democratic delegation will the national Democratic leadership accept?  MFDP insists that they’re going to be the party to be recognized. Democratic established leadership said, “That’s just not going to happen.”  Southern delegations in other states threaten to walk if Lyndon Johnson, Democratic National Committee admit or–yeah, admit–MFDP to the floor of the convention. Johnson’s already afraid of losing the South and now this is confirmation. And these were states that are already leaning towards Barry Goldwater anyway, the Republican candidate.\nAnyway, the convention arrives and Fannie Lou Hamer goes to the credentials committee, representing the MFDP, and starts to talk with them about why the MFDP needs to be recognized as the proper delegation. This is the committee that’s setting the rules for the conference, for the convention. And her statement is captured on live TV. This is when you’d have what, what is it called?  Gavel to gavel cover–coverage of conventions and such. And she starts telling a story about her efforts to organize people to exercise their full civil rights just to vote, get them to register to vote, and being arrested by the police, being taken to jail. And while she’s in jail for breaking no law, they put–the jailors stand by and get two black inmates, bring them over and threaten them with further punishment if they did not beat Fannie Lou Hamer, and they beat her senseless. She survives the beating, she survives it, but is physically, permanently damaged from the beating. This is what being a citizen meant if you’re an African American activist in Mississippi. Could end up like James Chaney, could be beaten to an inch of your life like Fannie Lou Hamer, certainly sending signals to the rest of black Mississippians.\nWell, while Hamer is giving this testimony to the credentials committee, Lyndon Johnson, still in Washington, D.C., at the White House, hears about it, knows it’s going out live and is furious, and immediately calls a press conference trying–[student sneezes] Bless you–trying to simply distract the media from what’s now airing over the country. Just a trumped up news conference. He had nothing to actually talk about. A lot of the cameras stay with Hamer, but Johnson recognizes that he’s losing grip of retaining any, any hope of keeping the white South. He asks his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, to get Walter Mondale to coordinate this resolution to a dispute, and the resolution says that the Mississippi–Mississippi delegation, the Democratic delegation, Democratic Party would be seated if they swore allegiance to Johnson’s civil rights platform. But–And in addition to that, two delegates from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would also join the Mississippi Democratic delegation.\nAll but three of the Mississippi Democratic Party delegates, the “formally” elected delegates–this is an all-white, all-white party in Mississippi, I should have said in the beginning–all but three of the Mississippi delegates bolt, and the MFDP refuses to compromise. “You either seat all of us or none of us.”  The Democratic Party National Convention ultimately recognizes just three of the delegates from Mississippi who didn’t leave. The rest of the Mississippi delegation votes for Barry Goldwater. The MF–the, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates ultimately vote for LBJ. There’s no logical choice, frankly, between LBJ or Goldwater, as far as their actions were concerned. Johnson, of course, goes ahead and gets re-elected, or gets elected, I guess, for the first time in a landslide, but he loses five states in his native South. The states that were threatening to bolt if he caved in to the MFDP came through. He might have lost them anyway, but it becomes very, very clear to Johnson at this point, to any Democratic activist, that the black vote is now critical in the South, if there’s any hope to hang onto a Democratic presence.\nChapter 2. Martin Luther King, Jr Advocates a New Voter Registration Drive [00:15:55]\nSo this is the end of the summer in 1964. Civil Rights Act is there, but the question of the vote is unresolved. Civil Rights Act does not address voting. Right away, activists on the ground and those at the highest reaches of the federal government, Democratic Party at least, hone in on voting. This is the next, this is the next challenge. Meanwhile, Martin Luther King is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He goes to Oslo to receive it, and he returns in January of sixty-five to participate in this next wave of challenges, the vote. He goes–In January of sixty-five he goes to Selma, Alabama, Dallas County, Selma, Alabama, and he announces a new SCLC initiative to register people to vote. The sheriff in the county, a guy named James Clark, was much like–oh my goodness–our favorite punch–punching bag from Birmingham.\nStudents:  <>\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Ah, you guys were paying attention. Thank you, Bull Connor–much like Bull Connor. So he’s, he’s pulling out cattle prods, clubs and tear gas to break up crowds. I mean he is ripe for becoming a target of national media coverage. The situation in Selma is really quite astonishing–in, in Dallas County, I should say, not Selma. The larger district. In Dallas County, out of fifteen thousand people who are registered to vote, only three hundred and thirty-five of them are black. Now if you don’t know Alabama, it’s important to understand, it is a state with, in many places, a majority black population, and in all places, a significant black population. So in Dallas County, there is no black voting presence. In Alabama in general, seventy-seven percent, over three quarters of eligible blacks, are still off the voting rolls. It’s a much higher percentage than what you see in other places, other southern–throughout the South in general.\nSo King goes down there to announce a new voter registration drive, knowing that the sheriff would be one he could bait pretty easily. Rallies are organized, marches are planned. Middle of February, peaceful SCLC rally in a neighboring, neighboring area was attacked by the police. The city police, the county police and the state police. And during the melee, one of the people involved in the rally, a twenty-six year-old named Jimmie Lee Jackson, according to witnesses, shields his mother who’s in the process of getting beaten by a state trooper, and he’s shot in the stomach and dies. Now the police account of what happened is different, as one would expect, but the fact of the matter is, he’s shot in the stomach, and he dies. Guaranteeing—I mean this would be horrible enough as it is, and one would hope gather attention, but what guaranteed gathering the attention to this fact is that news cameras were there. And in the, in the confusion of the rally being broken up by the police, several reporters from NBC are injured. Essentially attacked, hit–they get beaten up by the police as well. Guarantees national coverage.\nA plan evolves immediately to march from Selma, where Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered, from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital, fifty miles away. The original plan was to take Jimmie Lee’s body along this path and leave him at the state house stairs. And, very quickly, saner heads prevail. This is disrespectful to the body, of course. But the fact is the plan for a march from Selma to Montgomery is hatched. On March 7th, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis, begins a march across–begins the march from Selma to Montgomery. He’s leading in single file order, maybe two or three across, six hundred protesters over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It’s very important to know that Martin Luther King was not there, even though he knows about the plans. This is the march.\n[Narrator:] We on the other side were Alabama state troopers, under orders from Governor Wallace to stop the marchers.\n<>\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Oh, I hit it a second too late. You can see right here in the fading out, that’s John Lewis, now Representative John Lewis, in the tan trench coat.\n[Narrator:]  <> was on the sideline.\n[Man: ] <> to your safety from being in this march and I’m <>  this as an unlawful offenses. You are to disperse. You are ordered to disperse. Go home or go to your church. This march will not continue. Is that clear to you? I’ve got nothing further to say to you. <> <>\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  Tear gas canisters.\n[video continues]\nProfessor Jonathan Holloway:  The march, the disruption of the march, is captured on live TV, of course, and shown across the nation, leading people to ask the same question that Fannie Lou Hamer asked when she was giving her testimony to the credentials committee: is this America?  Thousands flocked to Selma as a protest was announced, “We will march again” from across the country, black, white, doesn’t matter. They all come to Selma to right this injustice. This day becomes known as “Bloody Sunday.”  Two days later, King is there, and they’re going to march a second time. And this is a pattern that has grown to become quite irritating to a lot of activists on the ground, is that King, for all of his incredible charisma and power, is never right–really quite there at the moment of crisis. His presence creates a new moment of crisis, no doubt about it, but he wasn’t there getting beaten on Bloody Sunday. And this is a tension that has been there in the movement for years already, that when King arrives, the cameras show up; when he leaves, the cameras leave. In this case, the cameras were already there.\nThere’s a federal order banning the march, wanting a cool down period. King goes, “We’re going to have a march anyway.”  A bold statement. So on Tuesday, March 9th, King leads a much larger group of activists across the Edmund Pettus bridge and starts the march to Montgomery. This is not the famous march though. Crosses the bridge, the police are there like they were the last time. They tell him to turn around, the same script. “Go back to your churches” and whatnot. King asks, asks his followers to kneel and pray along with him and then, in a complete shock to those SNCC leaders who are still beaten and bloody from two days earlier, King tells them to go back to their churches. This is not what they had bargained for. They were going to press forward and do this all over again. More horrified to discover that King had negotiated–to keep the peace and respect the federal order, King had quietly negotiated this whole performance, so the police knew that if King stuck to his script, he would kneel and tell his flock to pray, you know, create the visual moment, and then disperse peacefully.\nSNCC leaders had no idea about this. They–so King came in and took their march, hijacked it, turned it into his circus, and then they didn’t even get to press forward to honor Jimmie Lee Jackson’s life. This is a very important moment in the movement. Not one that is–it’s not triumphed as the march, the eventual march to Montgomery that happens two weeks later, under incredible federal protection by the way. The slight cracks and fractures and fissures that were there between SNCC and SCLC–remember SNCC being organized under SCLC’s umbrella just five years ago at that point—the, the cracks are now wide open. And SNCC would no longer see itself as being part of SCLC’s organizing logic. And SNCC would no longer kowtow to King’s declarations. They are truly–it is truly its own organization, and as we’ll soon see, takes off on its own path.\nSo the march does proceed in–on the twenty-first. What’s that, forty-five years ago and a, and a few days. But the real drama in many ways, for the movement’s sake, is the drama that happens in the two attempts prior to that. So the issue is voting registration. This is what these rallies were about that where Jimmie Lee Jackson had been murdered. This is what the vote to Montgomery is, is all about recognizing the fact that African Americans still don’t have access to the ballot box. Meanwhile, a voting rights bill is bouncing around Congress, and Lyndon Johnson keeps upping the stakes, and, and in many ways throwing his presidency in harm’s way. He declares between the Tuesday turnaround march and the eventual march, he goes to joint session of Congress and astonishes Congress by quoting one of the famous lines of the movement. He says, you know, he’s basically saying, “As a nation, we cannot abide by treating our own citizens this way. Their struggle is our struggle and we shall overcome.”  It’s an astonishing moment, presidential rhetoric, Lyndon Johnson saying it.\nIn June of the same year, sixty-five, at Howard University’s graduate–graduation ceremony, Howard being the most important, largest historically black college and university, essentially mostly funded by the federal government, Johnson at the graduation ceremony says the following:\n“You do not–[coughs] excuse me—You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying, ‘Now you are free to go where you want, do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.’ You do not take a man who, for years, has been hobbled by chains, liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race saying, ‘You are free to compete with all the others,’ and still believe that you have been completely fair. This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek not just freedom, but opportunity; not just legal equity, but human ability; not just equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and as a result.”\nThis is part of LBJ rolling out affirmative action, sort of testing the waters essentially. But very quickly, affirmative action policies now become woven into federal policies as well. In fact, women who have been the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action, something I’ll probably say again in about three or four weeks, were not covered under the original umbrella of affirmative action. It was actually only added two years later and added by someone who was hostile to the whole idea. He thought, “My god, if we just add women to this thing, we’ll sink the whole program,” and people went along with it. He’s like, “Oh, I misjudged that one.” \nChapter 3. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 [00:31:07]\nAnyway, back to the summer of sixty-five, Johnson is going out on a limb, essentially, making clear he is going to be the civil rights presidency. Now he’s a president, president, and many other things as well, but he’s definitely the civil rights president. On August 6th of 1965, he signs the Voting Rights Act, an incredible effort to get it through. And the Voting Rights Act prohibited states from imposing literacy requirements as obstacles for accessing the ballot box. It’s the most successful way of cutting out the vote. And, most importantly, and this is the most important element, it allowed the attorney general to send federal examiners in, into any election where they thought voting rights might be curtailed.\nThe Voting Rights Act, just to make clear—and some of you may get–I mean I get, I get this email about once a year, or once every other year, that the Voting Rights Act is coming up before Congress and it’s gonna–they might not approve it, and they’ll end the right to vote for African Americans. My father sent it to me once, which drove me crazy. I’m like, “Dad, you know better than this.”  The fact is, the Voting Rights Act does not give anybody the right to vote. It gives the federal government the authority to protect the right to vote. It brings into bold relief the federal government’s ability and right to supersede in local affairs, which has been the, the nut of the, the bone of contention since the Voting Rights Act was passed.\nThe Voting Rights Act has, if you look forward from the moment of its passage in August sixty-five, makes a clear change. Within four years of its passage, three-fifths of adult blacks are registered to vote. It’s an astonishing shift. Between 1964 and sixty-nine, roughly the same period we’re talking about here, the number of registered black voters goes from, in Alabama, less than twenty percent of the population to over sixty percent of the population. In Mississippi, it goes to less than seven percent of the population to over two-thirds of the population, within five years. It’s a seismic shift, especially when you consider the number–the numbers we’re talking about in terms of the African American population. So there’s no disputing the fact the Voting Rights Act has a, a, a significant effect, as you look forward, the crystal ball, three or four, five years from the moment of its signing. It’s also clear the Voting Rights Act had astonishingly no effect in the immediate moment, in those places where blacks already had the right to vote. And this was made very clear, five days later, when the Watts community in Los Angeles goes up in flames.\nA few words about Watts. It’s a riot in the, if you know Los Angeles demography, in a portion of the city that is due south of central Los Angeles, a place that had been the home for the longest, for, for a couple of decades in the wake of the Second Great Migration, World War II, where black Los Angeles was overwhelmingly found. It was not a wealthy part of the city, not by any stretch. But people had the kinds of civil rights, citizenship rights they wouldn’t have had, African Americans, they wouldn’t have had in Mississippi or Alabama or Georgia. They also had, visually, a better quality of life than those people who are stuck in high rise slums in Chicago and New York City. There’s green spaces. There’s, well maybe they’re not homeowners, but their homes, were living in homes. They aren’t in high rises, certainly. There’s sunshine, for goodness’ sakes, there’s palm trees. But the fact is, there is incredible economic degradation, powerful sense of hopelessness, and a real feeling that you were not a citizen, even though you could, could vote. But it really had no great benefit to you.\nSo in Watts, the flashpoint revolves around an arrest that goes bad. Marquette Frye, an African American man living in that neighborhood, is stopped by the California Highway Patrol at night. He’d been drinking with his older brother. Cops pulled him over and they’re about to let him go, when another–this is Marquette Frye’s version–when another more belligerent crew of California Highway Patrol officers arrive. Frye’s mother arrives, wanting to know what’s going on, trying to get her son. And these new belligerent cops assault the mother. Frye is hit by a police officer as he is trying to protect his mother, thrown into a police car, sent off. The police version is rather different. Drunken driver, they pull Frye over, radio for assistance. Other police arrive. Meanwhile, a crowd arrives of citizens and residents of the area. Marquette Frye makes a play for one of the police officers’ guns, and they start wrestling with him, throw him in a car. And, immediately, the crowd that’s gathered around, a crowd that had been worn out by police brutality, historic police brutality in that area, city, the crowd starts to explode.\nWhat happens, ultimately, is that thirty-four people die the next handful of days. Over a thousand people are injured; four thousand are arrested; property damage in excess of two hundred million, which was a ton of money in 1965 if you think about it; damage ranging across a forty-six mile, square mile area, larger than Manhattan or San Francisco. Thirty-five thousand adults are deemed, quote, active rioters. Seventy-two thousand are deemed close spectators. And what, why this is important in the reports that follow is that the police are going in intermittently. It’s just one big logistics mess. Police are going in now and again to try to calm things down. The riot would be sporadic. There’d be a hot point over here, a fire would be started over there, or a fake fire alarm would be called, and police would go over there. The fire department would be called to a scene and then, and then they’d be showered with bottles and bricks and then snipers. It was an urban battle zone.\nSo a lot of people were active as rioters who never, you know, see justice, according to the police, because they’re the ones shooting from windows the police can never get to, for instance. Ultimately, sixteen thousand National Guard, LAPD, and California Highway Patrol officers are brought in. They militarize the zone in order to re-establish the peace. It’s a massive property riot. Food, stores that sell food, liquor stores, furniture stores, clothing stores are destroyed, especially those owned by middle- and upper-class whites. Churches, homes and libraries are relatively untouched. And I say this just to–you know some people will talk about whites–Watts as a mindless insurrection. I’m not defending the riot at any–to any extent, but it wasn’t mindless. Certainly something tactical by going after those institutions that the residents thought were keeping them down. Store owners who were black would write up, you know, “soul brother” in their window to prevent their store from being attacked. Now some of them got attacked anyway, because there’s certainly going to be some level of chaos in any kind of riot. But often they were passed over.\nFor white America, all of this happens completely out of the blue. After all, Lyndon Baines Johnson has just signed in the Voting Rights Act. “What else do you people want?” is essentially the mentality. “What else could you want?”  And what L.A. shows is that there are deep and fundamental problems, that the Civil Rights Movement, as far as its most famous rhetoric, you know, the right to vote, you know, the right to go, go into the front door of a bus–a restaurant, ride in a bus where you want to—L.A. had all those things already. It didn’t point to more fundamental economic problems. That’s what Watts was about.\nNow Watts, now whether the riot–I’m not going to play counter factual history: would the riot have happened if this or that hadn’t happened?  I, I don’t know. But what is clear is that just as people are struggling with this new tactical change in the movement, got to pursue the black vote, people are clearly struggling with a shift in tone. The kind of militancy and armed militancy that you see happening in Watts is becoming more recognizable and more frequent. Part of it grows out of the rhetoric, no doubt, of Malcolm X, even after he disavowed a lot of the rhetoric. This becomes very clear in next week’s reading. And part of it is–Part of it’s growing out of an increasing U.S. military occupation in this strange place they haven’t quite figured out yet called Vietnam, and people coming home from Vietnam with a different sense of how to pursue justice. There’s a fundamental shift in tone and you see it embodied in Watts, profound impatience.\nNow impatience is not just an urban or western and northern phenomenon. It’s an impatience that’s in the, in the heart of, quote, the movement as well, in the southeastern United States. Blacks are increasingly happy about, or impatient and frustrated with, the client-patron relationship in the South, and throughout the country really. And we’ll see, we’ll see next week, when we start talking about the Black Panther Party, how it becomes articulated in Oakland, California. It’s most famously the Black Panther Party. But it’s important to take a moment to talk about the first Black Panther Party in the context of shift and tones. [computer beeps] Oh, that’s my–I have something happening soon, I guess, my computer telling me I have to go. So let’s look at the first Black Panther Party.\nYou have the march from Selma to Montgomery, the, the famous march. So much of the political rhetoric talks about how–or historical rhetoric, it goes off without a hitch, incredible federal protection. But a hallmark to how great we are as a country because of how peaceful it was. It wasn’t so peaceful to everybody. One of the activists who came down to Selma to help out, a woman named Vi–Viola Liuzzo from Michigan, her job was working support for the march. And her job was to, in her car, ferry people back from Montgomery, from Montgomery back to Selma. She happens to be driving her car with some of the marchers in it, driving through Lowndes County, Alabama. A car pulls up next to her, rolls down the window, pulls out a shotgun, blows her away.\nA young man named Stokely Carmichael, northerner raised in the, in New York City, graduated from Howard University, goes down to participate in the Freedom Summer, rises to the leadership circle in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he’s sent–Stokely Carmichael is sent to Lowndes County to figure out what the heck is going on in this place. Trying to organize the black vote, partly in honor of Liuzzo’s assassination. What he finds in Lowndes is a population that is a predominantly black population, eighty-one percent black. It’s a black county. Black citizens of Lowndes were poor, they were landless, and economically dependent on a small, white, elite planter society. It’s apartheid. Blacks outnumbered whites overwhelmingly, eighty-one percent, but they were not registered to vote, and they actually feared civil rights agitation. It’s like, “What are you doing coming in here?  Our life is horrible, but you’re going to get us killed.” \nAs Carmichael digs a little deeper in Lowndes, he finds, finds a different current though, and he just discovers that trying to register black Lowndes County citizens to vote in the Democratic Party is something he’s really not going to have much success doing. There’s such hostility and such hopelessness. But he also discovers a level of militancy there as well. So they form their own party, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, the LCFO. The Lowndes County Freedom Organization. And it has as its goal running candidates, developing a platform, becoming a recognized party, an alternative to the Democratic Party, which had no relevance to black Mississippians living in Lowndes County. And the LCFO chooses as its mascot the black panther. And the logic was, LCFO leaders talked about the black panther as an animal that retreats when it’s pursued, until it’s backed into a corner, and then it springs forth with a life or death battle on its mind. And that’s how the Lowndes County farmers, they’re all farmers, felt. And importantly, they were armed. I mean, and this is no big deal. I mean, farmers in the South, everybody was armed. You shot your meals often. The party was armed, and it was uninterested in working with whites. Whites who sympathized, who wanted to help them, it’s like, “No, forget it.”  And this group, as we’ll see next week, becomes the inspiration for the famous Black Panther Party.\nNow very quickly, by this point, sixty-five, SNCC had, you know, is breaking apart from SCLC. It becomes affiliated with the, sort of the rising new left, the radical student organizations. It’s exploring other ideological options, instead it’s, it’s of what was then certainly radical in 1960, you know, integrating lunch counters, integrating places of, of, of commerce. SNCC links up with the Students for Democratic Society, SDS, for a while, but the racial politics become too complex, because SNCC leaders felt the whites were trying to take control of SDS, black leaders in SNCC. In January of 1966, Samuel Young, a twenty year-old Navy vet, African American, recruited by SNCC to be an organizer in Tuskegee, he’s killed for using a white bathroom. At that point, SNCC comes out against the war in Vietnam and, in doing so, isolates itself from mainstream civil rights organizations. Another major break in the fabric, rip in the fabric. In the wake of this, the Atlanta cell within SNCC, which is increase–increasingly radical, starts getting racially restless. In the spring of sixty-six, Stokely Carmichael, essentially now the leader of SNCC, produces a position paper that says:\n“White participation, as practiced in the past, is now obsolete. If we are to proceed toward true liberation, we must cut ourselves off from white people. We must form our own institutions, write our own histories.”\n“White participation, as practiced in the past, is now obsolete.”  Stokely Carmichael is now the chair of SNCC. Whites are now kicked out of the movement. I’m going to stop right there, but we are literally, quite literally, at the cusp of the famous articulation of Black Power. Certainly all the pieces are now in place, and the movement, the famous movement that we’ve all been taught about in our little grade books and stuff, begins its very quick descent into completely splintering apart. Those are the events from sixty-four to sixty-six. We’ll pick up from there, at there on Monday.\n')
